TI  - Atypical Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Variant.
PG  - e19252
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19252 [doi]
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a complex group of parasitic infectious diseases caused by
      intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania. It is a zoonosis mainly
      transmitted by the bite of infected female Phlebotomus or Lutzomyia sandflies.
      Clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis are diverse and can range from
      asymptomatic presentations to disseminated systemic disease. Cutaneous
      leishmaniasis is endemic in more than 80 countries in the world, having a
      predominance in tropical and subtropical regions. Although the majority of cases 
      follow a classic development, an increasing number of new and rare variants of
      cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. These variants should be suspected as
      a cause of diverse clinical presentations, especially in endemic regions and
      travelers, being a diagnostic challenge for physicians. We present a case of
      atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis found as a single verrucous plaque of eight
      months of evolution in the left posterior thigh of a 35-year-old man, who
      presented mild pruritus. The patient reported shrimp farming as his main
      occupational activity and was living in a rural region surrounded by forest on
      the Pacific coast of Ecuador. On dermatological examination, a single 4 x 5 cm
      verrucous plaque with irregular borders and a scaly erythematous violaceous
      aspect was found. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of
      lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate with plasmocytes and granulomatous
      inflammation. On the Giemsa stain, intracellular amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan
      bodies) were observed. The treatment consisted of intramuscular meglumine
      antimoniate, presenting significant improvement on follow-up.

TI  - Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activities of
      Bis(spiropyrazolone)cyclopropanes: A Potential Application against Leishmaniasis.
LID - 4960 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules26164960 [doi]
AB  - This work focuses on the search and development of drugs that may become new
      alternatives to the commercial drugs currently available for treatment of
      leishmaniasis. We have designed and synthesized 12 derivatives of
      bis(spiropyrazolone)cyclopropanes. We then characterized their potential
      application in therapeutic use. For this, the in vitro biological activities
      against three eukaryotic models-S. cerevisiae, five cancer cell lines, and the
      parasite L. mexicana-were evaluated. In addition, cytotoxicity against
      non-cancerous mammalian cells has been evaluated and other properties of interest
      have been characterized, such as genotoxicity, antioxidant properties and, in
      silico predictive adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). The
      results that we present here represent a first screening, indicating two
      derivatives of bis(spiropyrazolone)cyclopropanes as good candidates for the
      treatment of leishmaniasis. They have good specificity against parasites with
      respect to mammalian cells.

TI  - Peptides to Tackle Leishmaniasis: Current Status and Future Directions.
LID - 4400 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094400 [doi]
AB  - Peptide-based drugs are an attractive class of therapeutic agents, recently
      recognized by the pharmaceutical industry. These molecules are currently being
      used in the development of innovative therapies for diverse health conditions,
      including tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis. Despite its socioeconomic
      influence on public health, leishmaniasis remains long-neglected and categorized 
      as a poverty-related disease, with limited treatment options. Peptides with
      antileishmanial effects encountered to date are a structurally heterogeneous
      group, which can be found in different natural sources-amphibians, reptiles,
      insects, bacteria, marine organisms, mammals, plants, and others-or inspired by
      natural toxins or proteins. This review details the biochemical and structural
      characteristics of over one hundred peptides and their potential use as molecular
      frameworks for the design of antileishmanial drug leads. Additionally, we detail 
      the main chemical modifications or substitutions of amino acid residues carried
      out in the peptide sequence, and their implications in the development of
      antileishmanial candidates for clinical trials. Our bibliographic research
      highlights that the action of leishmanicidal peptides has been evaluated mainly
      using in vitro assays, with a special emphasis on the promastigote stage. In
      light of these findings, and considering the advances in the successful
      application of peptides in leishmaniasis chemotherapy, possible approaches and
      future directions are discussed here.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of allylamines in the treatment of cutaneous and
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis: A systematic review.
PG  - e0249628
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0249628 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis affect a million people yearly, leading
      to skin lesions and potentially disfiguring mucosal disease. Current treatments
      can have severe side effects. Allylamine drugs, like terbinafine, are safe,
      including during pregnancy. This review assesses efficacy and safety of
      allylamines for the treatment of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. It
      followed the PRISMA statement for reporting and was preregistered in
      PROSPERO(CRD4201809068). MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials, the Global Health Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and
      clinical trial registers were searched from their creation to May 24th, 2020. All
      original human, animal, and in vitro studies concerning allylamines and cutaneous
      or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis were eligible for inclusion. Comparators-if
      any-included both placebo or alternative cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis
      treatments. Complete cure, growth inhibition, or adverse events served as
      outcomes. The search identified 312 publications, of which 22 were included in
      this systematic review. There were one uncontrolled and two randomised controlled
      trials. The only well-designed randomised controlled trial that compared the
      treatment efficacy of oral terbinafine versus intramuscular meglumine antimoniate
      in 80 Leismania tropica infected patients showed a non-significant lower cure
      rate for terbinafine vs meglumine antimoniate (38% vs 53%). A meta-analysis could
      not be performed due to the small number of studies, their heterogeneity, and low
      quality. This systematic review shows that there is no evidence of efficacy of
      allylamine monotherapy against cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Further
      trials of allylamines should be carefully considered as the outcomes of an
      adequately designed trial were disappointing and in vitro studies indicate
      minimal effective concentrations that are not achieved in the skin during
      standard doses. However, the in vitro synergistic effects of allylamines combined
      with triazole drugs warrant further exploration.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lutzomyia reburra (Diptera:
      Phlebotominae), in Rural Tourist Locations, Biosphere Reserve and Leishmaniasis
      Endemic Area, Ecuador.
PG  - 1905-1912
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjaa102 [doi]
AB  - This research represents the first attempt to assess the spatial and temporal
      distribution based on micro-meso scales on two species with different host
      preference habits (anthropophilic vs zoophilic), in the major Leishmaniasis
      endemic area in Ecuador, tourist locations, and Biosphere reserve. Phlebotomine
      species, Lutzomyia trapidoi (Fairchild) and Lutzomyia reburra (Fairchild and
      Hertig), were analyzed by trap/habitat/month/locality/altitude, through the
      Poisson generalized regression model. Our data reveal a bimodal pattern for both 
      species related with low precipitations and preference for forest habitat.
      Altitude, proximity to the forest, and the river were the variables that
      determine the hypervolume of the spatial distribution of relative abundance,
      where the overlap of these two species increases the risk of translocation and
      circulation of the etiological agent of leishmaniasis in sylvatic environments to
      rural-tourist-biosphere reserve areas and vice versa. The ecological
      characteristics of these two phlebotomines could explain the permanence of the
      major active and endemic focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the North-Western
      Ecuador a key aspect in tourism health-security in alternative tourism.

AB  - An 88-year-old man with mutilating mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) involving septal
      perforation, with granulomas in the pharynx and larynx, was treated with oral
      miltefosine, 50 mg three times/day for 28 days. Miltefosine, an antineoplastic
      agent, is considered an alternative option for the treatment of ML, showing
      efficacies of 75-92% in Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina. The patient denied having
      previous cutaneous (CL) leishmaniasis, and no CL lesions were recognized by
      physical examination. Parasites obtained from mucosal lesions were identified by 
      cytochrome b gene sequencing as Leishmania guyanensis. Clinical cure was observed
      2 months posttreatment, and no evidence of reactivation was observed in the
      3-year follow-up. Adverse effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, and
      epigastric pain were experienced during treatment with miltefosine. There is a
      need for improved access to miltefosine in leishmaniasis-endemic areas of Latin
      America and a greater awareness of ML and its treatment among physicians working 
      in endemic countries.

AB  - By employing protected human bait landing and modified Shannon light trap, a
      total of 1924 phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia spp. were captured in an area from 
      which L. (V.) guyanensis was reported as the causative parasite of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis (CL). The sand flies captured alive were dissected and identified
      at species level, based mainly on their spermathecae. At the same time, the sand 
      flies dissected were searched for the Leishmania parasites by microscopic-test,
      and later on by PCR-test. No positive sand flies were detected by both tests,
      while considerable numbers of anthropophilic sand fly species of the genus
      Lutzomyia were observed as probable vectors of the Leishmania parasite in the
      areas. Those were eight species, Lu. robusta, Lu. trapidoi, Lu. maranonensis, Lu.
      gomezi, Lu. shannoni, Lu. migonei, Lu. punctigeniculata and Lu. spathotrichia.
      Among them, the first two species Lu. robusta and Lu. trapidoi were most
      dominant, suggesting probable vectors of the Leishmania parasite prevailing in
      the area. Lu. punctigeniculata and Lu. spathotrichia were for the first time
      recorded for the Manabi province, Ecuador. These findings provide basic
      information useful for future planning of the control and management of the
      disease in the areas, though further study to incriminate the vector sand fly
      remains.

      Ecuador.
PG  - 20190141
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2019.0141 [doi]
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by
      species of Phlebotominae sand flies. CL is responsible for more than 1000
      reported cases per year in Ecuador. Vector collection studies in Ecuador suggest 
      that there is a strong association between the ecological diversity of an
      ecosystem, the presence of potential alternative or reservoir hosts and the
      abundance of sand fly species. Data collected from a coastal community in Ecuador
      showed that Leishmania parasites may be circulating in diverse hosts, including
      mammalian and potentially avian species, and these hosts may serve as potential
      hosts for the parasite. There has been limited reporting of CL cases in Ecuador
      because the disease is non-fatal and its surveillance system is passive. Hence,
      the actual incidence of CL is unknown. In this study, an epidemic model was
      developed and analysed to understand the complexity of CL transmission dynamics
      with potential non-human hosts in the coastal ecosystem and to estimate critical 
      epidemiological quantities for Ecuador. The model is fitted to the 2010 CL
      outbreak in the town of Valle Hermoso in the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas
      province of Ecuador and parameters such as CL transmission rates in different
      types of hosts (primary and alternative), and levels of case reporting in the
      town are estimated. The results suggest that the current surveillance in this
      region fails to capture 38% (with 95% CI (29%, 47%)) of the actual number of
      cases under the assumption that alternative hosts are dead-end hosts and that the
      mean CL reproduction number in the town is 3.9. This means that on the average
      3.9 new human CL cases were generated by a single infectious human in the town
      during the initial period of the 2010 outbreak. Moreover, major outbreaks of CL
      in Ecuador in coastal settings are unavoidable until reporting through the
      surveillance system is improved and alternative hosts are managed properly. The
      estimated infection transmission probabilities from alternative hosts to sand
      flies, and sand flies to alternative hosts are 27% and 32%, respectively. The
      analysis highlights that vector control and alternative host management are two
      effective programmes for Ecuador but need to be implemented concurrently to avoid
      future major outbreaks.

PG  - e0007403
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007403 [doi]
AB  - PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analyses targeting multiple
      nuclear genes were established for the simple and practical identification of
      Leishmania species without using expensive equipment. This method was applied to 
      92 clinical samples collected at 33 sites in 14 provinces of Ecuador, which have 
      been identified at the species level by the kinetoplast cytochrome b (cyt b) gene
      sequence analysis, and the results obtained by the two analyses were compared.
      Although most results corresponded between the two analyses, PCR-RFLP analyses
      revealed distribution of hybrid strains between Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis
      and L. (V.) braziliensis and between L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) panamensis,
      of which the latter was firstly identified in Ecuador. Moreover, unexpected
      parasite strains having the kinetoplast cyt b gene of L. (V.) braziliensis and
      nuclear genes of L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (V.) panamensis, or a hybrid between L.
      (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) panamensis were identified. This is the first report 
      of the distribution of a protozoan parasite having mismatches between kinetoplast
      and nuclear genes, known as mito-nuclear discordance. The result demonstrated
      that genetically complex Leishmania strains are present in Ecuador. Since genetic
      exchanges such as hybrid formation were suggested to cause higher pathogenicity
      in Leishmania and may be transmitted by more species of sand flies, further
      country-wide epidemiological studies on clinical symptoms, as well as
      transmissible vectors, will be necessary.

TI  - Efficacy of Four Solanum spp. Extracts in an Animal Model of Cutaneous
      Leishmaniasis.
LID - E49 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicines5020049 [doi]
AB  - Background: Leishmaniasis is a complex protozoa disease caused by Leishmania
      genus (Trypanosomatidae family). Currently, there have been renewed interests
      worldwide in plants as pharmaceutical agents. In this study, the in vivo efficacy
      of Solanum spp. is assessed in an L. amazonensis BALB/c mice model for
      experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis. Methods: Animals were infected with 5 x
      10(6) metacyclic promastigotes and 30-day post-infection, a treatment with 30
      mg/kg of Solanum extracts or Glucantime((R)) (GTM) was applied intralesionally
      every four days to complete 5 doses. Results: Neither death nor loss of weight
      higher than 10% was observed. All the tested extracts were able to control the
      infection, compared with the infected and untreated group. Solanum havanense
      Jacq. extract showed the highest efficacy and was superior (p < 0.05) to GTM.
      Solanum myriacanthum Dunal., S. nudum Dunal. and S. seaforthianum Andr. extracts 
      demonstrated a similar effect (p > 0.05) to GTM. An increase of IFN-gamma (p <
      0.05) was displayed only by animals treated with S. nudum compared to the group
      treated with a vehicle, while no differences (p > 0.05) were observed for IL-12. 
      Conclusions:In vivo effects of Solanum extracts were demonstrated, suggesting
      that this genus could be further explored as a new antileishmanial alternative.

AB  - The current four year study was undertaken to investigate the clinical and
      epidemiological features of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis infections in Valle
      Hermoso, Santo Domingo de Los Tsachilas province, north-central Pacific areas of 
      Ecuador. A total of 155 parasitologically confirmed
      (Leishmania-amastigote-positive) clinical cases diagnosed at a rural health
      center during January 2014-December 2017 were analyzed thoroughly. Molecular
      characterization of the causative Leishmania parasites from different endemic
      sites within the study areas was performed by PCR amplification of cytochrome b
      (cyt b) sequencing. All the FTA-card and/or smear impregnated materials tested
      were characterized, and identified as L. (V.) guyanensis, without detecting any
      other Leishmania species. The following features were described: 1) the majority 
      of patients were suffered from a single ulcer lesion (simple and mild to
      chronic), followed by multiple lesions, including recidiva cutis-"like" and
      Chiclero's ulcer-"like" clinical forms; 2) the majority (65.70%) of lesions were 
      less than 10mm in size, and distributed mainly on the upper body regions (arm,
      forearm, face, and neck including ear and head); 3) about 30% (29.68%) of the
      subjects tested were less than 10 years of age, strongly suggesting the intra-
      and/or peri-domestic transmission of the disease in the areas. The current
      clinico-epidemiological feature detected emphasizes the need for further such
      investigations of the L. (V.) guyanensis infections prevalent at different
      Pacific ecoregions of Ecuador, including Amazon regions.

AB  - The vector Lutzomyia sand flies and reservoir host mammals of the Leishmania
      parasites, causing the Andean cutaneous leishmaniasis (Andean-CL, uta) in Peru
      and Ecuador were thoroughly reviewed, performing a survey of literatures
      including our unpublished data. The Peruvian L. (V.) peruviana, a principal
      Leishmania species causing Andean-CL in Peru, possessed three Lutzomyia species, 
      Lu. peruensis, Lu. verrucarum and Lu. ayacuchensis as vectors, while the
      Ecuadorian L. (L.) mexicana parasite possessed only one species Lu. ayacuchensis 
      as the vector. Among these, the Ecuadorian showed a markedly higher rate of
      natural Leishmania infections. However, the monthly and diurnal biting activities
      were mostly similar among these vector species was in both countries, and the
      higher rates of infection (transmission) reported, corresponded to sand fly's
      higher monthly-activity season (rainy season). The Lu. tejadai sand fly
      participated as a vector of a hybrid parasite of L. (V.) braziliensis/L. (V.)
      peruviana in the Peruvian Andes. Dogs were considered to be principal reservoir
      hosts of the L. (V.) peruviana and L. (L.) mexicana parasites in both countries, 
      followed by other sylvatic mammals such as Phyllotis andium, Didelphis
      albiventris and Akodon sp. in Peru, and Rattus rattus in Ecuador, but information
      on the reservoir hosts/mammals was extremely poor in both countries. Thus, the
      Peruvian disease form demonstrated more complicated transmission dynamics than
      the Ecuadorian. A brief review was also given to the control of vector and
      reservoirs in the Andes areas. Such information is crucial for future development
      of the control strategies of the disease.

AB  - This study provides comprehensive information on the past and current status of
      the Andean cutaneous leishmaniasis (Andean-CL, uta) in Peru and Ecuador, mainly
      focusing on the causative Leishmania parasites and clinico-epidemiological
      features. Available information and data including our unpublished works were
      analyzed thoroughly. Endemic regions of the Andean-CL (uta) in Peru run from the 
      north Piura/Cajamarca to the south Ayacucho at a wide range of the Pacific
      watersheds of the Andes through several departments, while in Ecuador those exist
      at limited and spotted areas in the country's mid-southwestern two provinces,
      Azuay and Chimborazo. The principal species of the genus Leishmania are
      completely different at subgenus level, L. (Viannia) peruviana in Peru, and L.
      (Leishmania) mexicana and L. (L.) major-like (infrequent occurrence) in Ecuador. 
      The Peruvian uta is now prevalent in different age and sex groups, being not
      clearly defined as found in the past. The precise reasons are not known and
      should be elucidated further, though probable factors, such as emergence of other
      Leishmania parasites, non-immune peoples' migration into the areas, etc., were
      discussed briefly in the text. The Andean-CL cases in Ecuador are more rural than
      before, probably because of a rapid development of the Leishmania-positive
      communities and towns, and the change of life-styles of the inhabitants,
      including newly constructed houses and roads in the endemic areas. Such
      information is helpful for future management of the disease, not only for
      Leishmania-endemic areas in the Andes but also for other endemic areas.

TI  - Intralesional Infiltration with Meglumine Antimoniate for the Treatment of
      Leishmaniasis Recidiva Cutis in Ecuador.
PG  - 1508-1512
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.17-0340 [doi]
AB  - Meglumine Antimoniate (MA), administered intramuscularly for 21 continuous days
      is the recommended treatment of leishmaniases in Ecuador. However, because of its
      toxicity and requirement for intramuscular injections, treatment is frequently
      abandoned before completion. In addition, therapeutic failure and reactivation
      are not uncommon. Here we evaluate the efficacy and safety of MA administered
      intralesionally (IL) in leishmaniasis recidiva cutis (LRC). LRC is a special
      clinical variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis, characterized by reactivation at the
      edges of a primary cured lesion, presenting with active papules around the scar. 
      Twenty-one patients were included in the study. All were diagnosed
      parasitologically by one of three diagnostic methods (smear, culture, and
      Leishmanin skin test). Each patient received MA intralesionally weekly for 4
      weeks. Each papule was infiltrated until complete saturation. On average,
      patients received 1 mL of MA per administration. The criterion of cure was the
      complete resolution of the papules. Follow up was performed at 30, 90, and 180
      days after treatment. At day 30 after treatment, 19 (90.5%) of 21 patients were
      clinically cured. The two patients, who did not heal by the fourth application,
      were cured on the seventh and eighth dose, achieving a clinical cure of 100%
      without subsequent reactivation. Mild to moderate local pain during infiltration 
      was the only adverse reaction experienced by 81% of patients. In one case,
      subsequent infiltrations were discontinued because of a local allergic reaction. 
      Complete compliance of patients to treatment and the small volume of drug
      administered make this method of administering MA an effective, safe, and
      inexpensive alternative. Consequently, IL could replace intramuscular
      administration in the treatment of LRC in Ecuador.

AB  - Infant and young child skin diseases are among the most common features of
      morbidity throughout the tropics. Because the skin is directly exposed to the
      environment, it is considerably affected by climatic and local conditions such as
      vectors and microorganisms, as in the case of leishmaniasis. In America the
      observed magnitude of cutaneous leishmaniasis in children has led to the study of
      increased risk of exposure of this group due to the possibility of peri- and
      intradomiciliary transmission. The present review pretends to make a concrete
      approach all through the broad and main figures of this parasitic disease,
      including the clinical, physiopathological, epidemiological, diagnostic, and
      therapeutic aspects, in order to be used as a practical source of reference for
      pediatricians leading with tropical cutaneous pathology in the region.

TI  - [Case report: disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCD)].
PG  - 251-254
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified leishmaniasis as an
      uncontrolled and emerging disease. In Ecuador, the only anecdotal cases of
      diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded in 1994 and have not been formally 
      published. This form can be differentiated from classical localized cutaneous
      leishmaniasis by the number of injuries, the clinical type of the main elementary
      lesions (papular and acneform), and a weak response to standard treatments. The
      case we report is a 34-year-old woman who presented with disseminated nodular
      lesions and ulcers of various sizes with erythematous edges and scars. We report 
      the case and review diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis and the differences that can 
      be found with the other cutaneous variants. The diagnosis requires to be
      considered by primary care physicians in endemic areas and specialists, taking
      into account that this presentation can also occur in immunocompetent hosts.

AB  - AbstractReported herein is the first case of Leishmania-human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) coinfection in Ecuador. In Ecuador, HIV infections overlap endemic
      areas of leishmaniasis. Immunosuppression is a well-established risk factor for
      developing severe disease. This is a severe case of a 32-year-old man presenting 
      with disseminated pleomorphic ulcers, papules, and cutaneous plaque-like lesions 
      over his whole body. Numerous amastigotes were observed in both skin scrapings
      and biopsies. The sequence of the cytochrome b gene confirmed the presence of
      Leishmania guyanensis. The patient was treated but failed to respond to meglumine
      antimoniate and amphotericin B. Six months later, the patient died due to
      bacterial septic shock.

      Ecuador and a brief review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Ecuador, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is prevalent countrywide,
      but only one case of diffuse-CL and two cases of disseminated-CL were experienced
      during our research activities more than 30 years from 1982 to date. These three 
      patients suffered from multiple lesions distributed at a wide range of the body
      surface, revealing difficulty to clinically differentiate each other. METHODS:
      There is a considerable confusion of the use and/or differentiation of the
      terminologies (terms) between the two disease forms, diffuse-CL and
      disseminated-CL. One of the aims of the present study is to clarify the
      difference between the two disease forms, mainly based on the cases experienced
      in Ecuador. RESULTS: The disseminated-CL case newly reported here was clinically 
      very similar to the diffuse-CL case, but the former showed the following marked
      differences from the latter: (1) the organisms isolated were identified as the
      parasites of Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis/panamensis, which are also known as 
      the causative agents of disseminated-CL in different endemic countries of the New
      World; (2) the patient was sensitive against antimonials; and (3) mucosal
      involvement was observed, which is never observed in diffuse-CL. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      the text, three clinical cases, one diffuse-CL and two disseminated-CL, were
      presented. Furthermore, a bibliographic comparison of the features between the
      two disease forms was made, and a brief comment was also given.

AB  - A PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) targeting the mannose
      phosphate isomerase gene was established to differentiate Leishmania species
      distributed near the Department of Huanuco, Peru. The technique was applied to
      267 DNA samples extracted from Giemsa-stained smears of cutaneous lesions taken
      from patients suspected for cutaneous leishmaniasis in the area, and the present 
      status of causative Leishmania species was identified. Of 114 PCR-amplified
      samples, 22, 19, 24 and 49 samples were identified to be infected by Leishmania
      (Viannia) braziliensis, L. (V.) peruviana, L. (V.) guyanensis, and a hybrid of L.
      (V.) braziliensis/L. (V.) peruviana, respectively, and the validity of PCR-RFLP
      was confirmed by sequence analysis. Since PCR-RFLP is simple and rapid, the
      technique will be a useful tool for the epidemiological study of leishmaniasis.

      through a retrospective analysis of recent cases.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by hemoflagellates of the genus
      Leishmania and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected phlebotomine
      sandflies. Depending on the Leishmania species, the disease has different
      clinical forms including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral manifestations.
      Previous studies performed in endemic zones of northwestern-Argentina, during
      epidemic outbreaks, have been important for detecting patients suffering from the
      acute phase of the disease, but have not given a complete representation of the
      clinical and epidemiological features in the region. Furthermore, due to the
      resurgence of leishmaniasis worldwide and in particular the large increase of
      international tourism to the region, it seems pertinent to update the current
      epidemiological and clinical profile of leishmaniasis in northwestern-Argentina. 
      Here we present a retrospective analysis of 95 Leishmania positive cases,
      presenting between 2000 and 2014. Patients were derived from hospitals and
      diagnosed in our lab at the University of Salta, located in a non-endemic area in
      Salta, Argentina. We detected numerous extensive mucocutaneous cases (34/95,
      35.8%) distinct from mucosal affected patients, some instances originating in
      locations with no previously reported human cases. Additionally patients
      suffering from concomitant diseases, besides leishmaniasis, were assessed. These 
      included Chagas disease, syphilis, deep mycoses, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and 
      intestinal parasitosis. This study updates the clinical and epidemiological
      features of leishmaniasis in northwestern-Argentina, and discusses the
      implications and management strategy for patients who acquire the disease in this
      region.

AB  - Leishmaniasis remains one of the world's most neglected diseases, and early
      detection of the infectious agent, especially in developing countries, will
      require a simple and rapid test. In this study, we established a quick, one-step,
      single-tube, highly sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay
      for rapid detection of Leishmania DNA from tissue materials spotted on an FTA
      card. An FTA-LAMP with pre-added malachite green was performed at 64 degrees C
      for 60min using a heating block and/or water bath and DNA amplification was
      detected immediately after incubation. The LAMP assay had high detection
      sensitivity down to a level of 0.01 parasites per mul. The field- and
      clinic-applicability of the colorimetric FTA-LAMP assay was demonstrated with 122
      clinical samples collected from patients suspected of having cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in Peru, from which 71 positives were detected. The LAMP assay in
      combination with an FTA card described here is rapid and sensitive, as well as
      simple to perform, and has great potential usefulness for diagnosis and
      surveillance of leishmaniasis in endemic areas.

      leishmaniasis is endemic in the majority of countries. There are no previous
      reports of phlebotomine sand fly host feeding sources in Ecuador. We identified
      blood meal sources for phlebotomine sand fly species in Valle Hermoso, a hyper
      endemic area for leishmaniasis in Ecuador. Phlebotomine sand fly collections were
      carried out during the dry and rainy seasons. PCR and multiplex PCR were
      performed from DNA extracted from the abdomens of blood-fed females to
      specifically identify the avian and mammalian blood meal sources. Avian-blood
      (77%), mammalian-blood (16%) and mixed avian-mammalian blood (7%) were found in
      the samples. At the species level, blood from chickens (35.5%), humans (2.8%),
      cows (2.8%) and dogs (1.9%) was specifically detected. Nyssomyia trapidoi was the
      most common species of Lutzomyia found that fed on birds. The present results may
      aid the development of effective strategies to control leishmaniasis in Ecuador.

AB  - Leishmaniases comprise zoonotic diseases caused by protozoan flagellates of the
      Leishmania genus. They are endemic to South America, and the visceral form has
      been recently reported in Argentina. Dogs can play different roles in the
      Leishmania transmission cycles, depending mainly on the species of parasite
      involved. Here we focused on the clinical characterization of canine
      leishmaniasis (CanL) in Northeast Argentina and on the molecular typing of its
      etiological agent. The nested polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of 
      the Leishmania cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was performed on DNA templates purified 
      from lymph nodes, bone marrow or spleen aspirates obtained from 48 dogs
      previously diagnosed by the observation of Leishmania amastigotes on smears from 
      these aspirates. Their clinical and epidemiological data were also recorded.
      Systemic abnormalities were observed in 46 subjects (95.8%), most frequently
      lymphadenopathy, and emaciation (89.6 and 75%). Furthermore, 87% also presented
      tegumentary abnormalities, such as alopecia (54.2%) or secondary skin lesions
      (47.9%), among others. Twenty three dogs were positive for cyt b amplification.
      The sequence analysis showed the presence of two genotypes, LiA1 and LiA2,
      assigned to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, with 99.9 and 100% homology with
      the reference strain MHOM/TN/80/IPT1 respectively. LiA1 was identified in 18
      cases (78.3%) and LiA2 in five (21.7%). Two cyt b variants of L. (L.) infantum
      were incriminated as the causative agents of CanL cases from three cities:
      Posadas, Garupa, and Ituzaingo. All three cities are located in the northeastern 
      area of the country, where these parasites seem to be spreading in urban areas.

      Possible Reservoirs and Vectors.
PG  - 334-9

AB  - Cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) were not recorded until recently in
      the Chaco region of northwestern Argentina. Dogs were surveyed at the sites of
      infection of two HVL index cases in the Chaco region of Salta province. Canine
      cases (CanL) were diagnosed by two parasitological methods, two molecular methods
      targeting mini- and maxicircle DNA, and immunochromatographic dipstick. Among 77 
      dogs studied, 10 (13%) were found infected with Leishmania spp. In seven dogs and
      two humans, the infecting species was typed as Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. 
      The same genotype was detected in the human and two of the CanL. Although several
      diagnostic methods displayed weak or moderate agreement, the concordance values
      for serology versus maxicircle PCR were very good (Kappa index = 0.84). Sandflies
      captured in the area were identified as Lutzomyia migonei and Lu. cortelezzii/Lu.
      sallesi (cortelezzii complex). The focal appearance of leishmaniasis in dogs and 
      humans in a sylvatic region and its relatively low prevalence of infection
      suggests that L. (L.) infantum transmission to dogs and humans may, in this
      region, stem from sylvatic reservoirs.

TI  - Imported new world cutaneous leishmaniasis in a traveller from Slovakia.
PG  - 203-6
AB  - We present a case of imported leishmaniasis in a 31-year-old woman from Slovakia,
      who visited the countries of South America for three months in 2011. On 29 and 31
      August 2011, she was probably infected with Leishmania parasites in the jungles
      of Ecuador. Approximately one week after returning to Slovakia, a small papules
      appeared on patient's left leg. Another wound was found after two weeks. Both
      ulcers were enlarging. We proved amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. only in
      repeated dermal scrapings from the edge of the ulcer by Giemsa staining after
      negative results from examination of a wound scrape and biopsy specimen. We
      identified the species Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis as a causative agent by
      using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and subsequent sequencing of the
      ITS region. Closure of wounds and scab formation were observed after 20 days of
      treatment with sodium stibogluconate. In the control microscopic examination
      after the end of the treatment, parasites were not present, and the PCR confirmed
      the negative result (Fig. 2, Ref. 31).

AB  - An analysis of reported cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) was performed using
      the data registered in the southern Ecuadorian Amazon region during 27 years from
      1986 to 2012. The cases/subjects with both the suspected CL lesions and the
      amastigote-positive results were recruited for the analysis. The yearly
      occurrence of cases showed a markedly higher number during the six years, 1988
      and 1993. After 1994 when the insecticide spraying campaign using helicopter in
      1993-1994, the number dropped remarkably. Then, the yearly occurrence gradually
      fluctuated from 101 cases in 1996 to 11 in 2009, maintaining a low number of
      cases after the campaign. The monthly occurrence of cases showed a markedly high 
      number during March and August, suggesting a correlation to the rainy season
      (months) in the areas. A statistical significance was found between the monthly
      average number of the CL case and the average precipitation (p=0.01474). It was
      suggested that the time of transmission of CL would depend on the rainy seasons
      at each endemic area of Ecuador, which has a diverse climatic feature depending
      on the geographic regions. Such information at given leishmaniasis-endemic areas 
      of Ecuador would be important for the future planning of the disease control.
      Molecular analysis and characterization of clinical samples revealed the presence
      of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis.

AB  - Sequence analysis of the Lutzomyia (Lu.) ayacuchensis salivary gland cDNA library
      identified a short peptide containing an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence flanked by
      two cysteine residues in the C-terminal end as the most abundant transcript. In
      the present study, a recombinant protein of the RGD-containing peptide,
      designated ayadualin, was expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was
      characterized. Ayadualin inhibited both collagen and ADP-induced platelet
      aggregations by interfering with the binding of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 to
      fibrinogen. The RGD sequence and cysteine residues located on both sides of the
      RGD sequence were essential for the inhibitory action. Moreover, ayadualin
      efficiently inhibited the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway irrespective of the
      RGD sequence. Measuring the enzymatic activity of coagulation factors using
      chromogenic substrates revealed that ayadualin efficiently inhibited factor XIIa 
      (FXIIa) activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pre-incubation of
      ayadualin with FXII inhibited FXIIa activity, while activated FXIIa was not
      affected by ayadualin, indicating that ayadualin inhibits the activation of FXII,
      but not enzymatic activity of FXIIa. These results indicated that ayadualin plays
      an important role in the blood feeding of Lu. ayacuchensis by inhibiting host
      hemostasis via dual mechanisms.

AB  - Phlebotomine sand flies are the only proven vectors of leishmaniases, a group of 
      human and animal diseases. Accurate knowledge of sand fly species identification 
      is essential in understanding the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and vector
      control in endemic areas. Classical identification of sand fly species based on
      morphological characteristics often remains difficult and requires taxonomic
      expertise. Here, we generated DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 
      (COI) gene using 159 adult specimens morphologically identified to be 19 species 
      of sand flies, belonging to 6 subgenera/species groups circulating in Peru,
      including the vector species. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based on Kimura
      2-Parameter genetic distances formed non-overlapping clusters for all species.
      The levels of intraspecific genetic divergence ranged from 0 to 5.96%, whereas
      interspecific genetic divergence among different species ranged from 8.39 to
      19.08%. The generated COI barcodes could discriminate between all the sand fly
      taxa. Besides its success in separating known species, we found that DNA
      barcoding is useful in revealing population differentiation and cryptic
      diversity, and thus promises to be a valuable tool for epidemiological studies of
      leishmaniasis.

TI  - Sand fly fauna (Diptera, pcychodidae, phlebotominae) in different
      leishmaniasis-endemic areas of ecuador, surveyed using a newly named mini-shannon
      trap.
PG  - 163-70
LID - 10.2149/tmh.2014-20 [doi]
AB  - To study the sand fly fauna, surveys were performed at four different
      leishmaniasis-endemic sites in Ecuador from February 2013 to April 2014. A
      modified and simplified version of the conventional Shannon trap was named
      "mini-Shannon trap" and put to multiple uses at the different study sites in
      limited, forested and narrow spaces. The mini-Shannon, CDC light trap and
      protected human landing method were employed for sand fly collection. The species
      identification of sand flies was performed mainly based on the morphology of
      spermathecae and cibarium, after dissection of fresh samples. In this study,
      therefore, only female samples were used for analysis. A total of 1,480 female
      sand flies belonging to 25 Lutzomyia species were collected. The number of female
      sand flies collected was 417 (28.2%) using the mini-Shannon trap, 259 (17.5%)
      using the CDC light trap and 804 (54.3%) by human landing. The total number of
      sand flies per trap collected by the different methods was markedly affected by
      the study site, probably because of the various composition of species at each
      locality. Furthermore, as an additional study, the attraction of sand flies to
      mini-Shannon traps powered with LED white-light and LED black-light was
      investigated preliminarily, together with the CDC light trap and human landing.
      As a result, a total of 426 sand flies of nine Lutzomyia species, including seven
      man-biting and two non-biting species, were collected during three capture trials
      in May and June 2014 in an area endemic for leishmaniasis (La Ventura). The
      black-light proved relatively superior to the white-light with regard to capture 
      numbers, but no significant statistical difference was observed between the two
      traps.

AB  - Haplotype and gene network analyses were performed on mitochondrial cytochrome
      oxidase I and cytochrome b gene sequences of Lutzomyia (Lu.) ayacuchensis
      populations from Andean areas of Ecuador and southern Peru where the sand fly
      species transmit Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana and Leishmania (Viannia)
      peruviana, respectively, and populations from the northern Peruvian Andes, for
      which transmission of Leishmania by Lu. ayacuchensis has not been reported. The
      haplotype analyses showed higher intrapopulation genetic divergence in northern
      Peruvian Andes populations and less divergence in the southern Peru and Ecuador
      populations, suggesting that a population bottleneck occurred in the latter
      populations, but not in former ones. Importantly, both haplotype and phylogenetic
      analyses showed that populations from Ecuador consisted of clearly distinct
      clusters from southern Peru, and the two populations were separated from those of
      northern Peru.

AB  - A countrywide surveillance of sand flies was performed to obtain information on
      their geographical distribution and natural infection by Leishmania protozoa in
      Ecuador. A total of 18,119 sand flies were collected by human landing collections
      during 32 years from 1982 to 2014, and 29 species were recognized. The most
      prevalent 10 species were Lutzomyia gomezi, Lu. robusta, Lu. hartmanni, Lu.
      shannoni, Lu. trapidoi, Lu. panamensis, Lu. maranonensis, Lu. ayacuchensis, Lu.
      tortura and Lu. yuilli yuilli, and their topographical and vertical distributions
      were identified. Among all the sand flies, only 197 (1.09%) flies of four
      Lutzomyia species, Lu. gomezi, Lu. trapidoi, Lu. tortura and Lu. ayacuchensis,
      were positive for Leishmania. Endotrypanum, a flagellate parasite not pathogenic 
      to humans, were detected in five Lutzomyia species, Lu. robusta, Lu. hartmanni,
      Lu. trapidoi, Lu. panamensis and Lu. yuilli yuilli, suggesting wide vector-ranges
      of Endotrypanum species. These data on the genus Lutzomyia and their natural
      infections with Leishmania and Endotrypanum will be useful for transmission
      studies and surveillance of leishmaniasis.

AB  - Distribution of the vector species is a major risk factor for the endemicity of
      leishmaniasis. In the present study, the vertical distribution of Lutzomyia (Lu.)
      ayacuchensis, the vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana in the Ecuadorian
      Andes, was surveyed at different altitudes (300-2500m above sea level) of the
      Andean slope. The vector species Lu. ayacuchensis was identified at an altitude
      of 650m and a higher areas, and higher distribution ratio of the species was
      observed at higher altitudes. In addition, high ratios of L. (L.) mexicana
      infection were detected in higher areas, but none in lower populations of sand
      flies. Since an association between sand fly populations and vector competence is
      suggested in Lu. ayacuchensis, haplotype analysis was performed on the species
      from different altitudes of the study areas; however, no apparent difference was 
      observed among populations. These results suggested that Lu. ayacuchensis in
      Andean slope areas of Ecuador has the potential to transmit L. (L.) mexicana and 
      spread leishmaniasis in these areas.

      by kinetoplastid flagellates of the genus Leishmania. A total of 66 patients
      diagnosed as positive ATL cases from northwest Argentina were included in this
      study. Leishmania stocks were isolated in vitro and analyzed over promastigote
      cultures sown on FTA through nested PCR and sequence of cytochrome b (cyt b). The
      molecular analysis resulted in the incrimination of L. (Viannia) braziliensis as 
      the predominant species in the studied area, identifying two genotypes of L. (V.)
      braziliensis, 24 cases of Ab-1 cyt b and 41 cases of Ab-2 cyt b. One L. (V.)
      guyanensis strain was obtained from a traveler from the Brazilian Amazon. The
      prevalence of different genotypes was in agreement with previous studies,
      suggesting the necessity for new systems to study the genetic diversity in more
      detail. Most of the cases typified in this study were registered in the area of
      Zenta Valley (Oran, Hipolito Yrigoyen, and Pichanal cities), pointing a link
      between genotype and geographical origin of the sample. Sex and age distribution 
      of the patients indicate that the transmission was predominantly associated with 
      rural areas or rural activities, although the results might not exclude the
      possibility of peri-urban transmission. This work represents, so far, the largest
      isolation and molecular characterization of ATL cases in Argentina.

LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0690 [doi]
AB  - An 18-year-old female presented with a severe ulcerative lesion on her right ear 
      of 6 weeks duration. Her right ear was edematous and erythematous with a large,
      painless ulcerative lesion covering a third of the pinna and satellite papular
      lesions on the posterior. She was diagnosed with chiclero's ulcer. A skin smear
      stained with Diff-quik showed abundant Leishmania parasites. Chiclero's ulcer is 
      a rare clinical presentation and is typically severe and difficult to treat.
      Physicians in Ecuador recommend administering prolonged intramuscular Glucantime.
      Side effects are common and can be severe resulting in low patient compliance.
      Because of preferences of the patient and the large volume needed for her weight,
      we recommended topical treatment with a lotion of Glucantime mixed half and half 
      with white Merthiolate. After applying this lotion to the lesion 3 to 4 times a
      day for 6 weeks, the lesion healed.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and its associated complications, including
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and diffuse CL (DCL) have emerged as important 
      neglected tropical diseases in Latin America, especially in areas associated with
      human migration, conflict, and recent deforestation. Because of the limitations
      of current chemotherapeutic approaches to CL, MCL, and DCL, several prototype
      vaccines are in different states of product and clinical development. We
      constructed and utilized a Markov decision analytic computer model to evaluate
      the potential economic value of a preventative CL vaccine in seven countries in
      Latin America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.
      The results indicated that even a vaccine with a relatively short duration of
      protection and modest efficacy could be recommended for use in targeted
      locations, as it could prevent a substantial number of cases at low-cost and
      potentially even result in cost savings. If the population in the seven countries
      were vaccinated using a vaccine that provides at least 10 years of protection, an
      estimated 41,000-144,784 CL cases could be averted, each at a cost less than the 
      cost of current recommended treatments. Further, even a vaccine providing as
      little as five years duration of protection with as little as 50% efficacy
      remains cost-effective compared with chemotherapy; additional scenarios
      resembling epidemic settings such as the one that occurred in Chaparral, Colombia
      in 2004 demonstrate important economic benefits.

AB  - Many physicians in the United States and other nonendemic countries lack
      familiarity with New World cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and fail to include it in
      their differential diagnosis when seeing patients with suggestive lesions and
      recent high-risk travel. Moreover, even when the diagnosis of New World CL is
      considered and confirmed, physicians in the United States still face obstacles in
      obtaining appropriate treatment. In this report, we present 3 cases of New World 
      CL that were either initially misdiagnosed or faced significant delays in
      therapy. We also discuss the optimal approach by which to confirm New World CL
      and to collaborate with professional colleagues at the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention in treating individual patients. In particular, when
      pentavalent antimonial treatment is needed for treatment, physicians must obtain 
      appropriate diagnostic studies, communicate with experts at the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention, complete necessary paperwork, and obtain approval
      from their local institutional review board to administer it.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: For the assessment of the in vitro anti-protozoal potential of 
      plants traditionally used in Ecuador in the treatment of leishmaniasis, a
      combined approach based on interviews with healers as well as a literature search
      was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From three regions of Ecuador, 256 local 
      healers called "Agents of Traditional Medicine" (ATMs) were interviewed about
      their knowledge of the use of plants to treat and heal the illness recognized by 
      the ATMs as leishmaniasis. From literature sources, 14 plants were identified as 
      being used in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Subsequently, plant material was
      collected from a representative selection of 39 species. A total of 140 extracts 
      were screened in vitro against Leishmania donovani, Plasmodium falciparum,
      Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma cruzi. Additionally, these
      extracts were evaluated for their anti-microbial activities using five
      gram-positive and -negative bacteria as well as Candida albicans. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSIONS: The survey resulted in 431 use-records for 145 plant-taxa used for
      the treatment of leishmaniasis. The 10 most frequently reported taxa accounted
      for 37.7% of all records. In the case of leishmaniasis, activity was observed for
      Elephantopus mollis, Minquartia guianensis, Bocconia integrifolia, Gouania
      lupuloides, Scoparia dulcis, an as-yet-unidentified species of Piper and
      Brugmansia. For the leaves of M. guianensis and the twigs and bark of G.
      lupuloides a good selectivity index (SI) was found. IC(50) values and the SI of
      active plant extracts are presented.

TI  - Genetic diversity of ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer sequences in
      Lutzomyia species from areas endemic for New World cutaneous leishmaniasis.
PG  - 131-6
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.07.010 [doi]
AB  - In this study, each of 60 rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS2
      sequences was determined from 44 individuals of 14 morphologically identified New
      World sand fly Lutzomyia species in Ecuador, and their interspecies and
      intraspecies genetic diversity was compared. Distinguishing between related
      species based on the ITS1 sequence was difficult because of variability, while
      the genetic diversity of ITS2 was distinct even among closely related species.
      Further, an assessment of intraspecies ITS sequence diversity in the subgenus
      Helcocyrtomyia revealed no correlation between sequence variation and geographic 
      distribution. The results strongly suggested ITS2 to be a more suitable marker
      than ITS1 for the taxonomic analysis of Lutzomyia species including closely
      related species. Moreover, neither ITS sequence may be useful for the analysis of
      population structures in Lutzomyia species.

TI  - Molecular mass screening to incriminate sand fly vectors of Andean-type cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in Ecuador and Peru.
PG  - 719-21
AB  - Sand flies from the Andean areas of Ecuador and Peru were examined for Leishmania
      infections by using our recently established molecular mass screening method.
      Leishmanial minicircle DNA-positive sand flies were detected in 3 of 192 and 1 of
      462 samples from Ecuador and Peru, respectively. Sand fly species were identified
      by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, and the positive flies were Lutzomyia (Lu.)
      ayacuchensis and Lu. peruensis, respectively. Furthermore, cytochrome b and
      mannose-phosphate isomerase gene sequence analyses identified the parasites from 
      Ecuador and Peru as Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana and L. (Viannia) peruviana, 
      respectively. Thus, the mass screening method was confirmed to be a powerful tool
      for sand fly research.

TI  - Molecular typing of sand fly species (Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) from
      areas endemic for Leishmaniasis in Ecuador by PCR-RFLP of 18S ribosomal RNA gene.
PG  - 907-13
AB  - Surveillance of the distribution of sand fly species is important for prediction 
      of the risk and expansion of Leishmania infection in endemic and surrounding
      areas. In the present study, a simple and reliable method of typing New World
      Lutzomyia species circulating in endemic areas in Ecuador was established by
      using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism
      (RFLP) technique. PCR-RFLP of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes with the restriction
      enzyme AfaI and subsequently HinfI successfully identified seven sand fly species
      in nine endemic areas in Ecuador. Although intraspecific genetic-diversity
      affecting the RFLP-patterns was detected in a species, the patterns were species 
      specific. The method promises to be a powerful tool for the classification of New
      World Lutzomyia species.

TI  - Leishmaniasis recidiva cutis due to Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis in
      subtropical Ecuador: isoenzymatic characterization.
PG  - 116-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information regarding leishmaniasis recidiva cutis (LRC), a clinical 
      variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis, in the New World is scarce. LRC is
      characterized by slowly progressing lesion(s) that appear after a variable period
      of time, from months to years, in or around the scar of an apparently clinically 
      healed sore. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients are reported who presented with
      crusted, papular lesions located on the edge of a healed scar, with a mean of
      18.2 months of slowly progressive evolution. The isolated strains of Leishmania
      parasites were characterized by enzyme electrophoresis. Eleven enzyme systems
      were assayed. Skin biopsies from the active border of the lesions were taken for 
      histopathology. RESULTS: Tissue sections showed a granulomatous,
      lymphohistiocytic, dermal infiltrate containing Langhans' giant cells. The
      anamnestic data, together with the clinical and histopathologic findings, support
      the diagnosis of LRC. The isoenzyme profile of Leishmania parasites isolated from
      five of the six patients identified them as Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first reported evidence of LRC within the
      clinical spectrum of American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Ecuador, and of its
      causative agent. The existence of LRC has future implications for both disease
      treatment and vaccine development.

TI  - Atypical clinical variants in New World cutaneous leishmaniasis: disseminated,
      erysipeloid, and recidiva cutis due to Leishmania (V.) panamensis.
PG  - 281-4
AB  - In recent times, there has been an increase in the number of reports for new and 
      rare variants of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Here, we describe three unusual
      clinical forms of CL identified in Ecuadorian children. A total of 131 patients
      with CL were diagnosed over a 2-year period of active search. In 3 (2.29%), the
      lesions were very unusual; these included erysipeloid, recidiva cutis (LRC), and 
      disseminated leishmaniasis (DL). The erysipeloid case is characterized by
      erythematous and indurated plaque seen on the face of a 5-year-old boy; the LRC
      one is differentiated by slowly progressing red-brown papules around large scars 
      of healed sores in a 6-year-old girl, and the DL case is characterized by dozens 
      of cutaneous ulcers distributed in the whole body of a 1-year-old girl.
      Leishmania parasites were isolated by lesion aspirate and analyzed by the
      technique multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE). All three isolates were
      identified as Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis. These distinct clinical variants
      rarely have been reported previously in the American cutaneous leishmaniasis, and
      for the first time L. (V.) panamensis was identified as the etiologic agent. Our 
      cases extend the spectrum of clinical presentations in New World leishmaniasis.

TI  - Epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Ecuador: current status of knowledge -- a
      review.
PG  - 663-72
AB  - Although leishmaniasis is regarded as a significant health problem in Ecuador by 
      the Ministry of Health, and the incidence has increased over the last years, an
      official map on the geographic distribution of disease and sand fly vectors or a 
      control strategy do not exist yet. This article reviews the current situation
      based on published information to improve our knowledge and understand the
      epidemiological situation of leishmaniasis in Ecuador in order to help future
      research and to develop a national control strategy. The disease is endemic in
      most provinces throughout Pacific coastal region, Amazonian lowlands, and some
      inter-Andean valleys with a total 21,805 cases reported during 1990-2003. Whereas
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is found throughout Ecuador, mucocutaneous
      leishmaniasis (MCL) appears to be restricted to the Amazon region; one,
      parasitologically unconfirmed case of visceral form was reported in 1949. Most
      human infections are caused by Leishmania (Viannia) spp., which is distributed in
      the subtropical and tropical lowlands; infections due to L. (Leishmania) spp. are
      found in the Andean highlands and in the Pacific lowlands as well. The proven
      vectors are Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lu. ayacuchensis. Canis familiaris, Sciurus
      vulgaris, Potos flavus, and Tamandua tetradactyla have been found infected with
      Leishmania spp. It is estimated that around 3000-4500 people may be infected
      every year, and that 3.1 to 4.5 millions people are estimated to be at risk of
      contracting leishmaniasis.

TI  - Itraconazole in the treatment of New World mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.
PG  - 659-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: A well-tolerated oral drug is required for the treatment of
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Current parenteral treatment regimens with
      pentavalent antimonials are associated with marked toxicity and significant rates
      of relapse. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose
      itraconazole for the treatment of MCL. METHODS: An uncontrolled treatment study
      was performed in 13 Ecuadorian patients with MCL. Each patient received a daily
      dosage of 400 mg of itraconazole for a minimum of 3 months. RESULTS: All 13
      subjects responded to itraconazole during the first month of treatment, but by 12
      months after treatment the complete resolution of MCL lesions was observed in
      only three (23%) subjects. No adverse effects of treatment were reported.
      Response to treatment was associated with a short evolution of the disease and
      mild to moderate disease severity. CONCLUSION: Prolonged and high-dose treatment 
      regimens with itraconazole are not effective for the treatment of the majority of
      patients with MCL.

PG  - 1320-6
AB  - The safety, immunogenecity, and efficacy of two doses of an autoclaved-killed,
      whole cell Leishmania amazonensis vaccine (IFLA/BR/67/PH8) and BCG adjuvant (n = 
      750) against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) was compared with placebo (n = 756) in 
      a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study. Systemic and local side-effects 
      were more frequent in the vaccine than placebo group. Leishmanin skin test (LST) 
      conversion was greater in the vaccine than placebo group 2 months after the
      second vaccination dose (74.4% versus 14.7%; P = 0.000001). The 26-month
      incidence of confirmed CL (n = 25) was similar between the vaccine (2.0%) and
      placebo groups (2.0% versus 1.3%; P > 0.05). LST conversion was not associated
      with CL protection and the vaccine did not offer significant protection against
      CL infection caused by L. Viannia spp. compared to placebo.

TI  - Field trial of a vaccine against new world cutaneous leishmaniasis in an at-risk 
      child population: how long does protection last?
PG  - 1959-61
AB  - During 12 months of follow-up in a randomized double-blind controlled field
      study, a killed whole-promastigote vaccine cocktail plus bacille Calmette-Guerin 
      (BCG) adjuvant significantly reduced the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis
      (CL) in Ecuadorian children, compared with BCG alone. To determine how much
      longer protection might continue, the study was reblinded to permit 48 additional
      months of follow-up. During months 13-18, CL incidence remained lower in the
      vaccine group, compared with that in the control group (5.9% vs. 13.8%; chi2=8.8;
      P=.003), with vaccine efficacy calculated at 56.5% (95% confidence interval,
      18.7%-76.7%); however, during months 24-60, no significant between-group
      differences were detected. Periodic administration of boosters may be necessary
      to maintain whole-parasite-vaccine protection against New World CL.

OAB - The UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical
      Diseases (TDR) has been concerned with the production of vaccines and drugs
      against leishmaniasis for a number of years. Weapons against the responsible
      parasite are slowly being improved. Recent reports from vaccine trials in
      Ecuador, Iran, and India have yielded encouraging results. In Ecuador, more than 
      70% of vaccinated children in one study were protected from cutaneous
      leishmaniasis (CL). The vaccine provided was given in 2 doses and consisted of
      whole killed Leishmania. In Iran, TDR supported the trial of a single dose
      vaccine in an area endemic for anthroponotic CL and with relatively low
      incidence, and another trial in an area endemic for zoonotic CL. The vaccines
      were comprised of whole killed L. major promastigotes together with BCG as
      adjuvant. 2 trials of vaccines given in single doses were supported by TDR. In a 
      study in Bihar, India, aminosidine therapy yielded a 30-34% greater cure rate
      than did the standard regimen of pentostam. Aminosidine also had a low incidence 
      of adverse reactions and was well tolerated.

TI  - Usefulness of sampling with cotton swab for PCR-diagnosis of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in the New World.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - In this study, we tested the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-method to diagnose
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) by taking exudate materials from lesions with cotton
      swabs, using our previously tested (PCR) panel comprised of Leishmania (Viannia) 
      panamensis, L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (Leishmania) mexicana
      and L. (L.) amazonensis. The objectives of the present study were to improve the 
      sampling method convenient for the patients and to test the usefulness of samples
      taken with cotton swabs. Sixteen patients were clinically diagnosed to have CL
      including one case of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) in Ecuador and the
      causative Leishmania parasites were identified by PCR. All the 12 samples from CL
      patients of La Mana, positive for Leishmania DNA, were identified as L. (V.)
      panamensis, while two from CL of Huigra and one from DCL of San Ignacio were L.
      (L.) mexicana. In the field condition, taking biopsy material is not only painful
      but sometimes causes iatrogenic bacterial infections. Considering the sensitivity
      of the test, and convenient sampling procedure, it may be suggested that
      collection of exudates using cotton swabs may be a better alternative to biopsy
      sample for PCR-diagnosis of CL.

TI  - The traditional and conventional medical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in 
      rural Ecuador.
PG  - 395-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge, beliefs, and practices (KBPs) regarding
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) treatment held by an endemic population in Ecuador. 
      METHODS: A follow-up to research done several years before, this study used
      random cluster sampling to select 529 adults who lived in rural northwestern
      Ecuador. Data were collected over a 24-month period using in-depth interviews
      supplemented with qualitative methods. RESULTS: Most of the subjects were
      familiar with CL. The interviewed persons described a large, diverse ethnomedical
      treatment inventory. Contrary to expectations, few treatment KBPs were predicted 
      by gender, age, or prior CL experience. Factors reported as important in
      treatment decisions included female reproductive status, CL "type" (perceived
      form of the illness), lesion location, number of other infected household
      members, cost of the various treatments, treatment availability, and perceived
      treatment effectiveness. Subjects' strong motivation for prompt treatment
      appeared to be associated with beliefs regarding the inability of CL lesions to
      heal spontaneously, the disease's propensity to progress into fatal illnesses,
      and disfigurement. Despite increased familiarity with Glucantime (meglumine
      antimonate), the conventional pentavalent antimonial drug used to treat CL in
      Ecuador, the proportion of subjects who had used it in their treatment remained
      low (20%) while the prevalence of premature drug discontinuance appeared to have 
      doubled in comparison to our earlier study. CONCLUSIONS: By itself, increased
      access to Glucantime is unlikely to increase usage of the drug and to reduce its 
      frequent premature discontinuance unless public health planners accommodate the
      health and illness world views of local populations. Efficacy and safety studies 
      should be undertaken to investigate promising traditional remedies as possible
      alternatives to Glucantime.

TI  - The epidemiology and control of leishmaniasis in Andean countries.
PG  - 925-50
AB  - This paper reviews the current knowledge of leishmaniasis epidemiology in
      Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. In all 5 countries leishmaniasis
      is endemic in both the Andean highlands and the Amazon basin. The sandfly vectors
      belong to subgenera Helcocyrtomyia, Nyssomiya, Lutzomyia, and Psychodopygus, and 
      the Verrucarum group. Most human infections are caused by Leishmania in the
      Viannia subgenus. Human Leishmania infections cause cutaneous lesions, with a
      minority of L. (Viannia) infections leading to mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.
      Visceral leishmaniasis and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis are both rare. In each
      country a significant proportion of Leishmania transmission is in or around
      houses, often close to coffee or cacao plantations. Reservoir hosts for domestic 
      transmission cycles are uncertain. The paper first addresses the burden of
      disease caused by leishmaniasis, focusing on both incidence rates and on the
      variability in symptoms. Such information should provide a rational basis for
      prioritizing control resources, and for selecting therapy regimes. Secondly, we
      describe the variation in transmission ecology, outlining those variables which
      might affect the prevention strategies. Finally, we look at the current control
      strategies and review the recent studies on control.

TI  - Leishmania mini-exon genes for molecular epidemiology of leishmaniasis in China
      and Ecuador.
PG  - 393-9
AB  - The mini-exon gene is unique and is tandemly repeated in the Leishmania genome.
      The transcribed region is highly conserved, but the non-transcribed spacer region
      is distinct in length and in sequence among different Leishmania species. The
      usefulness of PCR amplification of the Leishmania mini-exon gene was examined for
      molecular epidemiology of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. We previously
      described a PCR method for amplification of the mini-exon gene and obtained
      positive amplification in bone marrow aspirates of patients with visceral
      leishmaniasis in China. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced two PCR
      products from the patients. The sequences of two products revealed 100% identity 
      and showed more similarity to the mini-exon gene of L. donovani Indian strain
      than those of L. donovani complex in Africa and South America. We also applied
      this PCR method to the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We obtained positive
      PCR amplification in skin biopsy materials taken from patients with cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in Ecuador. Since this PCR amplification is simple and requires
      only a pair of primers to detect all Leishmania species distributed in Ecuador,
      the method may be a useful tool for the detection of parasites, not only from
      patients, but also from sandflies and reservoir animals in this area of
      endemicity.

      doses of a whole, killed promastigote vaccine cocktail plus bacille
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) adjuvant. Control subjects got 2 doses of BCG only. The
      subjects who received both vaccination doses, 438 in the vaccine group (79.3%)
      and 406 in the control group (83.4%), were followed for 12 months. No serious
      adverse side effects were identified in either group. Significantly more vaccine 
      group subjects than controls converted to a positive Montenegro skin test (85.1% 
      vs. 20.1%; chi2 = 279; P < .001). The incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis was
      significantly reduced in the vaccine compared with the control group (2.1% vs.
      7.6%; chi2 = 8.95; P < .003). The protective efficacy of the vaccine was 72.9%
      (95% confidence interval = 36.1%-88.5%).

TI  - The epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in subtropical Ecuador.
PG  - 140-52
AB  - An epidemiologic survey (n = 466) was conducted in an area of subtropical
      rainforest in north-west Ecuador with the following objectives: (1) to determine 
      the prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), (2) to identify the Leishmania
      species causing human disease, (3) to investigate the major clinical
      manifestations of leishmaniasis, (4) to study cellular and humoral immune
      response indicators associated with disease status and (5) to identify risk
      factors for CL. Fourteen percent of subjects had parasitologically confirmed CL; 
      33% had evidence of prior disease. However, 17.2% of subjects with a negative CL 
      clinical history presented with a positive Montenegro skin test (MST), indicating
      the possibility of subclinical infection. The species isolated from subject
      lesions were L. guyanensis (63%), L. panamensis (33%), and L. brazilensis (4%).
      Mean specific anti-Leishmania IgG and IgM OD serum levels were highest in
      subjects diagnosed with current CL, followed by those with prior CL, and were
      lowest in healthy subjects, respectively (0.56 +/- 0.27 vs 0.33 +/- 0.2 vs 0.22
      +/- 0.14; F-ratio = 74; P < 0.00001) and (665 +/- 270 vs 481 +/- 220 vs 301 +/-
      128.5; F-ratio = 37; P < 0.00001). Likewise, subjects with present CL had
      measurably higher MST reactions (13 +/- 6.7 mm) than those with prior CL (10.9
      +/- 7.8 mm) or healthy individuals (2.4 +/- 2.5 mm; F-ratio = 106; P < 0.00001). 
      Serum concentrations of IgG were predicted by lesion number (t = 2.5; P = 0.018),
      size (t = 3.7; P = 0.0006), and duration (t = 3.5; P = 0.0013). Furthermore, the 
      MST induration size increased as a function of lesion number (t = 3.0; P = 0.005)
      and size (t = 3.4; P = 0.022). Subject age and sex did not predict serum IgG or
      IgM concentrations or MST reactions in the 3 disease groups. Although no sex
      differences were found with respect to clinical characteristics, children < or = 
      12 years of age were almost 3 times more likely to have CL lesions or scars
      located on the face and head area compared to adults (OR = 2.75; 95% CI =
      1.4-5.6, P = 0.004). The risk factors associated with disease included age under 
      5 years (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.48-2.35), male gender in adults (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI
      = 1.1-7.8), and wood and/or cane exterior house walls (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI =
      1.4-2.5). In contrast, electric home lighting was associated with decreased risk 
      (AOR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.4-2.3). The results suggest that it may be possible to
      modify a portion of the risk of CL by making changes in the housing environment
      which may help to reduce the amount of human-vector contact.

PG  - 99-103
AB  - A direct immunofluorescent antibody (DIFMA) test using a Leishmania
      genus-specific monoclonal antibody was evaluated in the routine diagnosis of
      cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ecuador. This test was compared with the standard
      diagnostic techniques of scrapings, culture and histology. Diagnostic samples
      were taken from a total of 90 active dermal ulcers from patients from areas of
      Ecuador known to be endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis. DIFMA was positive in
      all lesions. It was shown to be significantly superior to standard diagnostic
      methods either alone or in combination. The sensitivity of DIFMA did not diminish
      with chronicity of lesions. This test proved to be extremely useful in the
      routine diagnosis of CL because it is highly sensitive, is easy to use and
      produces rapid results.

TI  - Nutritional status and cutaneous leishmaniasis in rural Ecuadorian children.
PG  - 22-8
LID - 10.1093/tropej/41.1.22 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between nutritional status and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) was 
      evaluated in 230 children living in a rural subtropical rainforest in Northwest
      Ecuador. One-third of the subjects had evidence of either current (13 per cent)
      or past CL infection (21 per cent). Subjects with current (4.71 +/- 0.44 mg) or
      previous disease (4.29 +/- 0.35 mg) had lower mean daily dietary iron intakes
      than non-infected children (5.45 +/- 0.2 mg; chi 2 = 0.048), but not energy,
      protein, or other micronutrients. The low dietary iron intake data was
      corroborated by the reduced mean haemoglobin values observed in children with
      current (11.7 +/- 0.3 mg/dL) or past infection (11.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dL) compared to
      non-infected subjects (12.7 +/- 0.15 mg/dL; F-ratio = 17.0, P < 0.0001). Mean
      hematocrit values were also lower in the two infected groups (37.4 +/- 0.9 per
      cent and 37.4 +/- 0.6 per cent v. 39.5 +/- 0.5 per cent; F-ratio = 4.23, P =
      0.0175). Furthermore, they were more likely to suffer from iron-deficiency
      anaemia than their non-infected counterparts (chi 2 = 4.64, P = 0.03). However,
      the children with active disease accounted for most of the excess risk for anemia
      (Fisher's exact test P = 0.009; OR = 10.0, exact 95 per cent CI = 1.37-111.8).
      Finally, growth stunting (< -2SD height-for-age) was more common in subjects with
      current (54 per cent) or past infection (51 per cent) compared to those without
      CL history (31 per cent; chi 2 = 8.03, P = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Leishmania major-like parasite, a pathogenic agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in 
      Paraguay.
PG  - 749-57
AB  - Leishmania parasites isolated from two patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis from
      geographically different localities in Paraguay have been characterized by enzyme
      electrophoresis (zymodeme) and digestion profiles of kinetoplast DNA with
      restriction enzymes (schizodeme). Both Paraguayan isolates showed identical
      zymodeme profiles to each other using 14 enzymes (glutamic pyruvate transaminase,
      glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, enolase, fumarate hydratase, glucose phosphate
      isomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme,
      mannose phosphate isomerase, nucleoside phosphorylase, peptidase-D,
      6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, and pyruvate kinase).
      Although two Paraguayan isolates showed different zymodeme profiles from those of
      six Leishmania reference strains of Old and New World Leishmania species, they
      showed identical zymodeme profiles to those of an L. major-like parasite from
      Ecuador. These observations were confirmed by schizodeme analysis using three
      restriction endonucleases (Msp I, Hae III, and Taq I). These results indicate
      that Leishmania parasites isolated in Paraguay are identified as an L. major-like
      parasite, and it is necessary to consider the existence of L. major-like
      parasites when classifying Leishmania isolates from the New World.

TI  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis in subtropical Ecuador: popular perceptions, knowledge,
      and treatment.
PG  - 142-55
AB  - Popular perceptions and knowledge about cutaneous leishmaniasis and its treatment
      were studied in an endemic area of subtropical Northwest Ecuador. Although most
      of the adults surveyed were familiar with the disease, the vector, and
      traditional treatments, many showed a lack of knowledge about transmission of the
      disease, ulcer healing, and conventional treatment. Gender was found to have a
      significant impact on disease risk, perceptions, and treatment knowledge. Males
      experienced a risk of contracting cutaneous leishmaniasis that was almost triple 
      that of women. Men were also more likely to perceive that the disease seriously
      diminished the victim's capacity to work. Women, on the other hand, were more
      prone to perceive that cutaneous leishmaniasis was a serious disease that
      significantly decreased self-esteem. Although 80% of the subjects knew at least
      one method of treating the disease, women tended to know more methods than men.
      Most of 150 different therapies reported involved the use of indigenous plants,
      chemicals, acids, antibiotics, heat treatments, or petroleum by-products. Some of
      these treatments could have clinical value. However, only 7% of the subjects knew
      about pentavalent antimonials. Almost 70% of the subjects with a past or present 
      infection history were treated solely by traditional methods; only 12% received a
      full course of Glucantime, while 7.5% got an incomplete course. The findings
      indicate that it will be important to consider the identified gaps in knowledge
      and gender perceptions regarding the disease and its treatment when planning
      future control programs.

OAB - In 1989-1991, a study of 466 children and adults (i.e., = or 18 years) living in 
      26 small agricultural villages in the remote subtropical forest of Northwest
      Pichincha Province on the western slope of the Andes Mountains in Ecuador
      examined perceptions and knowledge of cutaneous leishmaniasis and local methods
      used to treat it. 13% of all adult subjects had active cutaneous leishmaniasis.
      Men were 2.83 times more likely to have cutaneous leishmaniasis than women (p =
      .037), perhaps due to increased occupational exposure (i.e., agricultural work in
      the rain forest) and social exposure (i.e., outside during times of maximum
      vector activity). They were more likely to consider it to have a negative effect 
      on the affected person's capacity to work (77.3% vs. 61.2%; p = .025). Women were
      more likely than men to perceive it as a severe disease (85.2% vs. 68%; p = .015)
      that reduced the victim's self- esteem (89.9% vs.75.7%; p = .017). 97.3% of
      subjects were familiar with the sandfly vector, yet less than 10% knew it was
      responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis. 80% of adults knew at least 1 treatment 
      option. Women could name more treatment methods than men (1.6 vs. 1.2; p .05).
      The adults named more than 150 treatment options, most of which were traditional 
      methods involving the application of topical preparations or objects to the
      ulcers (e.g., herbs, trees, or other plants and homemade rum, wood alcohol,
      iodine, menthol, methiolate, and sulfur). Just 7% were familiar with antimonial
      drugs. Most adults and children who had either active cutaneous leishmaniasis or 
      a history of past infection (68%) had been treated with traditional methods. 8.5%
      received both traditional treatments and Glucantime. Just 12% received the full
      course of Glucantime therapy. 7.5% received an incomplete course of glucantime
      therapy. These results show that public health officials need to consider the
      gaps in knowledge and gender perceptions of cutaneous leishmaniasis and in its
      treatment when they plan control programs.

PG  - 43-9
AB  - The Zumba focus of tegumentary leishmaniasis lies in the southwards Amazonian
      region of Ecuador. A clinico-epidemiological study has been carried out in the
      area on 83 patients attending health centers. All the biotopes suitable for
      sandflies, including dwellings, have been sampled from February to September 1992
      by light trap and human bait catches. The number of sandflies caught amounts to
      2,547. Anthropophilic sandfly fauna is poor and only three species have been
      recorded. Lutzomyia serrana abounds inside dwellings where it bites men even
      during daytime. The parasite was identified as an intermediate form between
      Leishmania panamensis and L. braziliensis. It will be described elsewhere. The
      high proportion of facial lesions suggests a domiciliary transmission for which
      Lu. serrana could be a good vector candidate.

      coast].
PG  - 35-41
AB  - We have evaluated the impact of anthropization of the forest on the incidence of 
      leishmaniasis, due to Leishmania panamensis, in three coastal study areas,
      Corriente Grande (primary forest), Paraiso Escondido and La Tablada (secondary
      forest). The situation of isolated dwellings, in deforested areas, has also been 
      analysed in the last two stations. In each station, the study of the density of
      anthropophilic sand flies, specially Lutzomyia trapidoi, has been conducted in
      the domestic environment, coffee plantations and undergrowth. The incidence of
      leishmaniasis was nearly non existent in primary forest, though it ranged from
      106 to 147% in the more or less cleared forest. At Corriente Grande, none Lu.
      trapidoi was caught in houses. In the undergrowth, catches were low (8% of the
      total). At Paraiso Escondido, Lu. trapidoi was the dominant species, with more
      than 83% of the catches in the undergrowth and in the coffee plantations (41
      Man/hour), as well as in dwellings (10.6 M/h). At La Tablada, in the domestic
      environment, Lu. gomezi, was the dominant species: 2.8 M/h against 0.1 M/h for
      Lu. trapidoi. In the coffee plantations and in the undergrowth Lu. trapidoi was
      the main species, 21 M/h and 14 M/h. Thus in the primary rainforest,
      leishmaniasis transmission can be very low. In disturbed forest, coffee
      plantations near houses are good biotopes for Lu. trapidoi. The cycle of L.
      panamensis has been adapted to this new ecological situation, by being closer to 
      the houses. The reservoirs live and circulate throughout coffee plantations. In
      deforested areas, neither aggressive sand flies have been observed, nor
      leishmaniasis transmission.

      aspirates, biopsies and smears have been performed. From two dogs with ulcers
      only one had ulcers on the muzzle and the scrotum infected by Leishmania (L.
      guyanensis complex). The isolated strain was identified as Leishmania panamensis.
      The disease was strictly cutaneous. In the study area the dog seems to be more a 
      victim-host than a reservoir.

PG  - 23-8
AB  - Lutzomyia trapidoi, the more abundant anthropophilic species, is a presumed
      leishmaniasis vector in the Pacific foothills of Ecuador. Three biotopes have
      been sampled (dwelling, and nearby coffee crop and primary forest) in the focus
      of Paraiso Escondido, by human bait catches, from August 1991 to October 1992. A 
      large number of sandflies, 6,965 specimens, have been dissected to estimate peri 
      and hypopyloric infections. All the peripyloric infections, characterized by
      isoenzyme electrophoresis, were Leishmania panamensis. The percentage of these
      infections was low, around 3%, but they were massive. They occurred only in dry
      season. Hypopyloric infections were observed in Lu. trapidoi all the year round
      in the three biotopes. Their percentage was high, reaching 40%. Despite of many
      trials to cultivate the parasite on NNN medium, no stain could be isolated. It is
      suggested that the parasite could be L. equatorensis.

PG  - 13-21
AB  - In two leishmaniasis endemic foci of the Pacific coast of Ecuador, where the
      primary forest is severely attacked by human settlements, intradomiciliary
      sandfly catches, with light trap and human bait, have been carried out from
      August 1991 to October 1992. The presumed vector Lutzomyia trapidoi was by far
      the dominant species inside dwellings at Paraiso Escondido in the preandean hills
      (86% of the anthropophilic sandfly population, and 8.5 females/night catch by
      light trap). Not a single Lu. gomezi was caught in this village. At La Tablada,
      Lu. gomezi was the dominant anthropophilic species in the coastal cordillera (83%
      of anthropophilic sandfly population and 3.7 females/night catch by light trap); 
      Lu. trapidoi accounted only for 4.6% of the total catches in this village. On
      human bait, catches were variable depending on the day and on the season, but
      dominant species were always the same. The percentage of Lu. trapidoi was higher 
      on human bait than in light trap. Blood meal identifications of engorged Lu.
      gomezi and Lu. trapidoi confirmed the anthropophily of these two species in the
      houses.

      coast].
PG  - 1-12
AB  - A clinico-epidemiologic survey on cutaneous leishmaniasis, due to Leishmania
      panamensis, was carried out on 961 persons in two study areas of the Pacific
      coast of Ecuador, to estimate the prevalence and the incidence of the disease. In
      the preandean hills, at Paraiso Escondido, the prevalence of active lesions was
      4.8%; in the hills of the coastal cordillera, at La Tablada, it was 3.6%. The
      incidence of new cases in 1991 was high: 147% in the first village, and 106% in
      the second. These data are far higher than the Health Ministry statistics. The
      cumulated prevalence, obtained by addition of the scars and active lesions of
      leishmaniasis, was as high as 66% at Paraiso Escondido, and 47% at La Tablada.
      Most of the patients (62%) had only one ulcer or scar. Most of the people are
      contaminated during the first five years they live in these endemic areas.
      Nevertheless, the incidence remains high in all the age groups, because large
      numbers of migrants coming from non endemic regions are continuously settling in 
      these colonization areas. Interviews have shown that the contaminations had
      occurred in the dry season, between July and December. These findings were
      confirmed by passive case detection at the Hospital A. Egas of Santo Domingo
      which covered the region. Contamination of young children and position of the
      lesions on the face suggested a domiciliary transmission, like in Panama and on
      the Pacific coast of Colombia.

PG  - 92-4
AB  - Fifty-two patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) from the Pacific
      coast of Ecuador were treated topically with an ointment containing 15%
      paramomycin (PR) and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL) in vaselinum album
      (white soft paraffin; white petrolatum). After 20 applications (over 10 or 20 d) 
      all lesions showed complete epithelialization within the first 100 d. Five
      patients developed new lesions during the one year observation period; 2 of these
      were probably reinfections. Considering all 5 cases as treatment failures, the
      healing rates were: 72% after 50 d, 90% after 100 d, and 85% after 360 d. In a
      separate study in the same area, a group of 23 patients was left without
      treatment for 3 months. Only 9% of the untreated patients healed spontaneously
      after 50 d. Growth of the lesion, inflammation and pain were observed at the
      beginning of treatment. After treatment, most lesions healed rapidly without
      scars. The drug was well accepted by the patients and was easy to administer
      under tropical field conditions.

      in Ecuador.
PG  - 707-15
AB  - Molecular karyotypes of Leishmania isolates from patients with cutaneous
      leishmaniasis in Ecuador were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      and Southern blot hybridization. The DNA karyotypes of L. major-like parasites
      were similar between two human isolates from a lowland coastal and a highland
      Andean region, but were apparently different from those of eleven World Health
      Organization reference strains including L. major. The smallest chromosome of 240
      kilobases in L. major-like parasites was found to belong to the 715-class of
      small linear chromosomal DNAs, which have been shown to appear in some lines of
      Leishmania. Chromosome banding patterns of L. mexicana isolates exhibited a
      novel, ordered, chromosomal ladder, and were identical among four human isolates 
      and one canine isolate from a restricted geographic region in the Andes. On the
      other hand, minor chromosome size polymorphisms were observed among three L.
      panamensis isolates from different endemic regions near the Pacific Coast.
      Chromosomal locations of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase and
      P-glycoprotein genes revealed further differences in chromosomal organizations
      among these Leishmania species in Ecuador. These results indicate that karyotype 
      analysis by PFGE is useful for epidemiologic studies of leishmaniasis in Ecuador.

TI  - Placebo controlled treatment of Ecuadorian cutaneous leishmaniasis.
PG  - 92-7
AB  - Pentavalent antimony has been considered to be the standard treatment for
      leishmaniasis, but more recently, the orally administrable agent allopurinol
      ribonucleoside has been the subject of several clinical trials. In this study,
      these two agents were evaluated in patients with Ecuadorian cutaneous
      leishmaniasis. Patients were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups. The
      mean reduction in lesion size for the 28 patients treated with Pentostam (20 mg
      Sb/kg/day intramuscularly for 20 days) was 61%, 23%, and 11% after one, two, and 
      three weeks, respectively. There was a wide range in the individual values, and
      some lesions markedly enlarged in the first week of therapy. An initially healed 
      lesion was defined as one that had greater than 80% re-epithelialized by the
      1.5-month post-treatment followup. All Pentostam patients demonstrated this
      degree of lesion resolution (100% initial healing rate), but one patient showed
      evidence of relapse at the three month followup resulting in a 96% complete
      healing rate for the 12 month observation period. Patients in the untreated
      control group demonstrated a strikingly high rate of healing with 9 of 12
      patients having re-epithelialized all lesions after 1.5 months observation (75%
      initial healing rate). The mean reduction in lesion size for the untreated
      patients was 56%, 29%, and 25% after one, two, and three weeks, respectively.
      Twenty-one patients received allopurinol ribonucleoside (1,500 mg QID) plus
      probenecid (500 mg QID) for 28 days. Lesions in nine of these patients were
      healed at the time of the 1.5 month followup (41% healing rate).(ABSTRACT

TI  - Andean leishmaniasis in Ecuador caused by infection with Leishmania mexicana and 
      L. major-like parasites.
PG  - 205-17
AB  - Between 1986 and 1988, epidemiologic studies were carried out in a small rural
      community in an Andean region of Ecuador, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly
      endemic. A total of 25 human cases, positive for Leishmania parasites by culture 
      and/or smear, were examined. Fourteen of the cases were in infants less than one 
      year of age, suggesting intradomiciliary transmission of the disease. Clinically,
      many of these cases were similar to descriptions of "uta," a form of cutaneous
      leishmaniasis which occurs in Andean regions of Peru and is reported caused by L.
      peruviana. Of the 11 positive cultures obtained from human cases in the present
      study, eight were identified by molecular characterization as L. mexicana and
      three were identified as L. major-like. Two additional isolates of L. mexicana
      were also made from an infected dog and from a sand fly, Lutzomyia ayacuchensis, 
      living in the region, thus implicating the latter species as possible reservoir
      and vector, respectively, of L. mexicana in this highland community. The
      significance and validity of recent isolates of L. major-like parasites from the 
      New World are also discussed.

TI  - A review of leishmaniasis in Ecuador.
PG  - 64-76
AB  - This article briefly reviews current knowledge about leishmaniasis in
      Ecuador--proceeding from 1920, when the first human case was described, to the
      present. Regarding basic conditions, it appears that 14 of Ecuador's 20 provinces
      have endemic leishmaniasis. Nationally, over 4,000 cases were registered in the
      1983-1986 period. Of 260 cases cited in the literature from 1920 through 1987,
      240 (92.3%) were said to involve cutaneous forms of the disease and 18 (6.9%)
      mucocutaneous ones. Only one case each of visceral and diffuse cutaneous
      leishmaniasis was reported in 1920-1987, and neither of these has been confirmed.
      Various Leishmania strains isolated by the authors from wild animals and man are 
      currently being studied. To date, tests employing isoenzyme electrophoresis and
      monoclonal antibodies have identified some of the isolated strains as L.
      amazonensis and L. panamensis. At present it seems evident that a detailed study 
      of leishmaniasis transmission in Ecuador is needed in order to develop a plan for
      future control of the disease. Survey work directed at identifying the particular
      Leishmania varieties prevalent in the country's different endemic areas is also
      needed, as is research on the sandfly vectors and animal reservoirs of the
      disease.

TI  - The relationship between severity of ulcerated lesions and immune responses in
      the early stage of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ecuador.
PG  - 681-5
AB  - The relationship was examined between the severity of ulcerated lesions and
      immune responses in 19 Ecuadorian patients in the early stages of New World
      cutaneous leishmaniasis. As an immunological assay, the humoral immune response
      was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the cell-mediated
      response by delayed type skin test for leishmanial antigen (leishmanin test).
      There was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.61, P less than 0.01)
      between the total area of ulcerated lesions and the reciprocal titre of ELISA in 
      identical subjects. However, no significant difference was observed in the ELISA 
      titre between patients with a single lesion and those with multiple lesions (chi 
      2 = 7.06, df = 5, P greater than 0.2). A correlation (r = 0.48, P less than 0.05)
      was observed between the area of lesions and the intensity of leishmanin test;
      further, the ELISA titre also correlated to the intensity of leishmanin test in
      the identical subjects (r = 0.71, P less than 0.01). These results suggest that
      the severity of ulcerated lesions relates to the activation of both the humoral
      and cell-mediated immune systems in the early stage of New World cutaneous
      leishmaniasis.

TI  - Biting activity of two anthropophilic species of sandflies, Lutzomyia, in an
      endemic area of leishmaniasis in Ecuador.
PG  - 533-8
AB  - The biting patterns of Lutzomyia trapidoi and Lu. hartmanni, vectors of
      leishmaniasis, were studied using a human bait in an endemic area on the Pacific 
      slope of the Andes in Ecuador. The results suggest that Lu. trapidoi is primarily
      an early biter at dusk, with the first peak at 20.00-21.00 hours and the second
      at 03.00-04.00 hours; and that Lu. hartmanni bites more constantly throughout the
      night, with a pronounced peak between 23.00 and 24.00 hours. The biting activity,
      however, shows a marked variation at each site and between different collections 
      at the same site. The activity and the biting places on man are discussed in
      relation to human infection with leishmaniasis in the area and the location of
      lesions on patients.

TI  - Natural infections with promastigotes in man-biting species of sand flies in
      leishmaniasis-endemic areas of Ecuador.
PG  - 440-6
AB  - In order to determine the vectors of leishmaniasis in Ecuador, 1,054 man biting
      sand flies from the Department of Canar were dissected and examined for
      promastigotes. There were 2 man-biting species, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. hartmanni in
      this endemic area of the disease. The infection rates were 7.7% in the former and
      3.9% in the latter species, demonstrating the different rates in various
      localities and altitudes of the study areas. There was an association between
      infection rates and the time of day, suggesting some connection with biting
      activity of sand fly species. In collections using human bait at 7 study areas in
      5 Departments, 6 man-biting species were recognized, indicating different
      dominant species in each area. It was assumed that the dominant species would
      play an important role as the principal vector of leishmaniasis in each endemic
      area. As to species determination of the present Leishmania promastigotes,
      suffice it to say that the parasites are Leishmania sp., presumably L.
      braziliensis s.l., until the isolates have been typed.
