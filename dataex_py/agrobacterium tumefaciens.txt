TI  - Effects of Volatile Organic Compounds on Biofilms and Swimming Motility of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - 1512 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081512 [doi]
AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by bacteria play an important role in
      the interaction between microorganisms and other organisms. They can inhibit the 
      growth of phytopathogenic microorganisms, modulate plant growth, and serve as
      infochemicals. Here, we investigated the effects of ketones, alcohols, and
      terpenes on the colony biofilms of plant pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      strains and swimming motility, which can play an important role in the formation 
      of biofilms. It was shown that 2-octanone had the greatest inhibitory effect on
      biofilm formation, acting in a small amount (38.7 g/m(3)). Ketone 2-butanone and 
      unsaturated ketone beta-ionone reduced the formation of biofilms at higher doses 
      (145.2-580.6 and 387.1-1548.3 g/m(3), respectively, up to 2.5-5 times). Isoamyl
      alcohol and 2-phenylethanol decreased the formation of biofilms at doses of 88.7 
      and 122.9 g/m(3) by 1.7 and 5 times, respectively, with an increased effect at
      177.4 and 245.9 g/m(3), respectively. The agrobacteria cells in mature biofilms
      were more resistant to the action of ketones and alcohols. These VOCs also
      suppressed the swimming motility of agrobacteria; the radius of swimming zones
      decreased ~from 2 to 5 times. Terpenes (-)-limonene and (+)-alpha-pinene had no
      significant influence on the colony biofilms and swimming motility at the doses
      used. The results obtained represent new information about the effect of VOCs on 
      biofilms and the motility of bacteria.

TI  - Inhibition of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Growth and Biofilm Formation by Tannic
      Acid.
LID - 1619 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10071619 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens underlies the pathogenesis of crown gall disease and is
      characterized by tumor-like gall formation on the stems and roots of a wide
      variety of economically important plant species. The bacterium initiates
      infection by colonizing and forming biofilms on plant surfaces, and thus, novel
      compounds are required to prevent its growth and biofilm formation. In this
      study, we investigated the ability of tannic acid, which is ubiquitously present 
      in woody plants, to specifically inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of A.
      tumefaciens. Tannic acid showed antibacterial activity and significantly reduced 
      the biofilm formation on polystyrene and on the roots of Raphanus sativus as
      determined by 3D bright-field and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.
      Furthermore, tannic acid dose-dependently reduced the virulence features of A.
      tumefaciens, which are swimming motility, exopolysaccharide production, protease 
      production, and cell surface hydrophobicity. Transcriptional analysis of cells
      (Abs600 nm = 1.0) incubated with tannic acid for 24 h at 30 degrees C showed
      tannic acid most significantly downregulated the exoR gene, which is required for
      adhesion to surfaces. Tannic acid at 100 or 200 microg/mL limited the iron supply
      to A. tumefaciens and similarly reduced the biofilm formation to that performed
      by 0.1 mM EDTA. Notably, tannic acid did not significantly affect R. sativus
      germination even at 400 microg/mL. The findings of this study suggest that tannic
      acid has the potential to prevent growth and biofilm formation by A. tumefaciens 
      and thus infections resulting from A. tumefaciens colonization.

TI  - Engineering Agrobacterium tumefaciens Adhesion to Target Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00069 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen commonly repurposed for genetic
      modification of crops. Despite its versatility, it remains inefficient at
      transferring DNA to many hosts, including to animal cells. Like many pathogens,
      physical contact between A. tumefaciens and host cells promotes infection
      efficacy. Thus, improving the strength and specificity of A. tumefaciens to
      target cells has the potential for enhancing DNA transfer for biotechnological
      and therapeutic purposes. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for engineering
      genetically encoded exogeneous adhesins at the surface of A. tumefaciens. We
      identified an autotransporter gene we named Aat that is predicted to show
      canonical beta-barrel and passenger domains. We engineered the beta-barrel
      scaffold and linker (Aatbeta) to display synthetic adhesins susceptible to rewire
      A. tumefaciens to alternative host targets. As a proof of concept, we leveraged
      the versatility of a VHH domain to rewire A. tumefaciens adhesion to yeast and
      mammalian hosts displaying a GFP target receptor. Finally, to demonstrate how
      synthetic A. tumefaciens adhesion can improve transfer to host cells, we showed
      improved protein translocation into HeLa cells using a sensitive split luciferase
      reporter system. Engineering A. tumefaciens adhesion has therefore a strong
      potential in generating complex heterogeneous cellular assemblies and in
      improving DNA transfer efficiency against non-natural hosts.

AB  - TriR serves as a repressor for a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) efflux
      pump TriABC involved in triclosan (TCS) resistance in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
      The triR gene is transcribed divergently from the triABC operon. TriR
      specifically bound to the triR-triA intergenic region, at an imperfect 10 bp
      inverted repeat, 5'-TTGACTAttC-GgtTAGTCAA-3' (TriR box), that was revealed by
      DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TCS treatment
      appeared to up-regulate triR and triABC expression, via preventing TriR binding
      to the triR-triA intergenic region. Promoter-lacZ fusions and beta-galactosidase 
      activity assay further demonstrated TriR-mediated repression of triABC and triR
      autoregulation. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the identified TriR box is
      essential for TriR repression. A. tumefaciens mutant strains disrupting either
      triR or triA were constructed to determine their biological functions. The triA
      mutant showed hypersensitivity to TCS and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), whereas
      the triR mutant was hyper-resistant, compared to wild-type. In addition to TCS
      and SDS, overproduction of TriABC from a multi-copy plasmid conferred enhanced
      resistance to a quaternary ammonium compound, benzalkonium chloride. Molecular
      modelling was able to predict the model of TriR and docking simulations were able
      to anticipate plausible binding interactions between TriR and TCS ligand.

TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of Serine-72 reveals the location of the fructose
      6-phosphate regulatory site of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADP-glucose
      pyrophosphorylase.
PG  - e4376
LID - 10.1002/pro.4376 [doi]
AB  - The allosteric regulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is critical for the
      biosynthesis of glycogen in bacteria and starch in plants. The enzyme from
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens is activated by fructose 6-phosphate (Fru6P) and
      pyruvate (Pyr). The Pyr site has been recently found, but the site where Fru6P
      binds has remained unknown. We hypothesize that a sulfate ion previously found in
      the crystal structure reveals a part of the regulatory site mimicking the
      presence of the phosphoryl moiety of the activator Fru6P. Ser72 interacts with
      this sulfate ion and, if the hypothesis is correct, Ser72 would affect the
      interaction with Fru6P and activation of the enzyme. Here, we report structural, 
      binding, and kinetic analysis of Ser72 mutants of the A. tumefaciens ADP-glucose 
      pyrophosphorylase. By X-ray crystallography, we found that when Ser72 was
      replaced by Asp or Glu side chain carboxylates protruded into the sulfate-binding
      pocket. They would present a strong steric and electrostatic hindrance to the
      phosphoryl moiety of Fru6P, while being remote from the Pyr site. In agreement,
      we found that Fru6P could not activate or bind to S72E or S72D mutants, whereas
      Pyr was still an effective activator. These mutants also blocked the binding of
      the inhibitor AMP. This could potentially have biotechnological importance in
      obtaining enzyme forms insensitive to inhibition. Other mutations in this
      position (Ala, Cys, and Trp) confirmed the importance of Ser72 in regulation. We 
      propose that the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from A. tumefaciens have two
      distinct sites for Fru6P and Pyr working in tandem to regulate glycogen
      biosynthesis.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Candida glabrata.
LID - 596 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof8060596 [doi]
AB  - The use of broad-spectrum antimycotic therapy, immunosuppressive therapy, and
      indwelling medical devices has contributed to the increased frequency of mucosal 
      and systemic infections caused by Candida glabrata. A major concern for C.
      glabrata and other Candida spp. infections is the increase in drug resistance. To
      address these issues, additional molecular tools for the study of C. glabrata are
      needed. In this investigation, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      transformation system for C. glabrata. A number of parameters were investigated
      to determine their effect on transformation frequency, and then an optimized
      protocol was developed. The optimal conditions for the transformation of C.
      glabrata were found to be an infection incubation temperature of 26 degrees C,
      0.2 mM acetosyringone in both induction media and co-culture media, 0.7% agar
      concentration, and a multiplicity of infection of 50:1 A. tumefaciens to C.
      glabrata. Importantly, the frequency of multiple integrations was low (5%),
      demonstrating that A. tumefaciens generally integrates at single sites in C.
      glabrata, which is consistent with other fungal A. tumefaciens transformation
      systems. The development of this system in C. glabrata adds another tool for the 
      molecular manipulation of this increasingly important fungal pathogen.

AB  - The regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell or organ explant was a
      valuable task for plant biotechnology. However, important medicinal plants such
      as Catharanthus roseus have shown recalcitrance to regeneration protocols, thus
      limiting investigations on MIA metabolism and metabolic engineering in this plant
      system. In this chapter, successful regeneration protocols were detailed for
      Catharanthus roseus, either by direct shoot bud induction from leaf explants and 
      Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation.

PG  - 10510
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14864-w [doi]
AB  - The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by endophytic bacteria have a
      significant role in the control of phytopathogens. In this research, the VOCs
      produced by endophytic bacteria including Serratia sp. Ba10, Pantoea sp. Sa14,
      Enterobacter sp. Ou80, Pseudomonas sp. Ou22, Pseudomonas sp. Sn48 and Pseudomonas
      sp. Ba35, which were previously isolated from healthy domesticated and
      wild-growing grapevine were evaluated in terms of their effects on the virulence 
      traits of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Gh1, the causal agent of crown gall disease. 
      Based on the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, 16, 15, 14, 7, 16,
      and 15 VOCs have been identified with high quality in strains of Ba10, Sa14,
      Ou80, Ou22, Sn48, and Ba35, respectively. All endophytic bacteria produced VOCs
      that significantly reduced crown gall symptoms and inhibited the populations of
      A. tumefaciens Gh1 at different levels. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy
      analysis revealed various morphological abnormalities in the A. tumefaciens cells
      exposed to the VOCs produced by Ba35, Ou80, and Sn48 strains. The VOCs
      significantly reduced swarming-, swimming-, twitching motility and biofilm
      formation by A. tumefaciens Gh1. Our results revealed that VOCs could reduce the 
      attachment of A. tumefaciens Gh1 cells to root tissues of grapevine cultivars
      Rashe and Bidane sefid, as well as chemotaxis motility towards root extract of
      both cultivars. Based on our results, it was shown that the antibacterial VOCs
      produced by endophytic bacteria investigated in the current study can manage
      crown gall disease and increase our knowledge on the role of VOCs in microbial
      interactions.

PG  - 7195-7203
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07637-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seed beetles are one of the most important causes of yield loss in
      bean production. It is essential to develop resistant varieties in the fight
      against these pests. Agrobacterium-based gene transformation is the most widely
      used breeding method worldwide to develop insect-resistant varieties. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Embryonic axes and plumule explants were obtained from Agrobacterium
      tumefciens treated mature zygotic embryos of low and high raw protein-based
      common bean cultivars Akman 98 and Karacasehir 90. Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      contained a synthetic Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal protein gene
      (Bt Cry1Ab) controlled by the 35S promoter and NOS terminator sequences. The
      transformation event was genotype and explant dependent. The plumule explants
      could not withstand kanamycin-based selection pressure and died. It was possible 
      to get two transgenic plants using embryonic axis explants of low protein
      cultivar Akman 98. These results were validated using GUS analysis, PCR, RT-PCR, 
      bioassay analysis, and ELISA test from the samples taken from T0 and T1
      generations. Bioassay tests showed that these plants were protected from the
      damage of legume seed insects (Bruchus spp.). CONCLUSIONS: The results are very
      encouraging and may help in producing better transgenic common bean germplasm
      leading to safe agriculture and reducing environmental pollutions.

TI  - Development of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Infiltration of Infectious Clones of
      Grapevine Geminivirus A Directly into Greenhouse-Grown Grapevine and Nicotiana
      benthamiana Plants.
PG  - 1603-1609
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-01-22-0015-R [doi]
AB  - Grapevine virus infectious clones are important tools for fundamental studies,
      but also because of their potential for translational applications for grapevine 
      improvement. Although several grapevine virus infectious clones have been
      developed, there has been difficulty in directly infecting mature grapevine
      plants, and many of the viruses used still cause disease symptoms in grapevine
      plants, making them less likely candidates for biotechnological applications in
      grapes. Here, we developed an improved Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration
      method that can be used to deliver DNA plasmids and viral infectious clones
      directly into approximately 20- to 40-cm-high (above soil) greenhouse-grown
      grapevine plants. We also developed infectious clones for two isolates of
      grapevine geminivirus A (GGVA): Longyan (China; GenBank accession KX570611;
      GGVA-76) and Super Hamburg (Japan; GenBank accession KX570610; GGVA-93). Neither 
      virus caused any obvious symptoms when inoculated to plants of grapevine
      varieties Colombard, Salt Creek, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Vaccarese. However, the 
      two GGVA isolates induced different symptom severity and viral titer in Nicotiana
      benthamiana plants. The two GGVA isolates used here were found to accumulate to
      different titers in different parts/branches of the infected grapevine plants.
      The GGVA infectious clones and the improved grapevine infiltration technique
      developed here provide new, valuable tools that can be applied to grapevine
      plants, possibly even for translational applications such as disease management
      and desired trait improvements.

TI  - CRISPR RNA-guided integrase enables high-efficiency targeted genome engineering
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - 10.1111/pbi.13872 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causal agent of plant crown gall disease, has been
      widely used to genetically transform many plant species. The inter-kingdom gene
      transfer capability made Agrobacterium an essential tool and model system to
      study the mechanism of exporting and integrating a segment of bacterial DNA into 
      the plant genome. However, many biological processes such as Agrobacterium-host
      recognition and interaction are still elusive. To accelerate the understanding of
      this important plant pathogen and further improve its capacity in plant genetic
      engineering, we adopted a CRISPR RNA-guided integrase system for Agrobacterium
      genome engineering. In this work, we demonstrate that INsertion of Transposable
      Elements by Guide RNA-Assisted TargEting (INTEGRATE) can efficiently generate DNA
      insertions to enable targeted gene knockouts. In addition, in conjunction with
      Cre-loxP recombination system, we achieved precise deletions of large DNA
      fragments. This work provides new genetic engineering strategies for
      Agrobacterium species and their gene functional analyses.

TI  - Sequence and Structure-Guided Engineering of Urethanase from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens d3 for Improved Catalytic Activity.

AB  - The amidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens d3 (AmdA) degrades the carcinogenic
      ethyl carbamate (EC) in alcoholic beverages. However, its limited catalytic
      activity hinders practical applications. Here, multiple sequence alignment was
      first used to predict single variants with improved activity. Afterward,
      AlphaFold 2 was applied to predict the three-dimensional structure of AmdA and 21
      amino acids near the catalytic triad were randomized by saturation mutagenesis.
      Each of the mutation libraries was then screened, and the improved single
      variants were combined to obtain the best double variant I97L/G195A that showed a
      3.1-fold increase in the urethanase activity and a 1.5-fold increase in ethanol
      tolerance. MD simulations revealed that the mutations shortened the distance
      between catalytic residues and the substrate and enhanced the occurrence of a
      critical hydrogen bond in the catalytic pocket. This study displayed a useful
      strategy to engineer an amidase for the improvement of urethanase activity, and
      the variant obtained provided a good candidate for applications in the food
      industry.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens pathogenesis of plants is initiated with signal
      reception and culminates with transforming the genomic DNA of its host. The
      histidine sensor kinase VirA receives and reacts to discrete signaling molecules 
      for the full induction of the genes necessary for this process. Though many of
      the components of this process have been identified, the precise mechanism of how
      VirA coordinates the response to host signals, namely phenols and sugars, is
      unknown. Recent advances of molecular modeling have allowed us to test
      structure/function predictions and contextualize previous experiments with VirA. 
      In particular, the deep mind software AlphaFold has generated a structural model 
      for the entire protein, allowing us to construct a model that addresses the
      mechanism of VirA signal reception. Here, we deepen our analysis of the region of
      VirA that is critical for phenol reception, model and probe potential
      phenol-binding sites of VirA, and refine its mechanism to strengthen our
      understanding of A. tumefaciens signal perception.

TI  - Induction of AmpC-Mediated beta-Lactam Resistance Requires a Single Lytic
      Transglycosylase in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e0033322
LID - 10.1128/aem.00333-22 [doi]
AB  - The remarkable ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer DNA to plant
      cells has allowed the generation of important transgenic crops. One challenge of 
      A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is eliminating the bacteria after plant
      transformation to prevent detrimental effects to plants and the release of
      engineered bacteria to the environment. Here, we use a reverse-genetics approach 
      to identify genes involved in ampicillin resistance, with the goal of utilizing
      these antibiotic-sensitive strains for plant transformations. We show that
      treating A. tumefaciens C58 with ampicillin led to increased beta-lactamase
      production, a response dependent on the broad-spectrum beta-lactamase AmpC and
      its transcription factor, AmpR. Loss of the putative ampD orthologue atu2113 led 
      to constitutive production of AmpC-dependent beta-lactamase activity and
      ampicillin resistance. Finally, one cell wall remodeling enzyme, MltB3, was
      necessary for the AmpC-dependent beta-lactamase activity, and its loss elicited
      ampicillin and carbenicillin sensitivity in the A. tumefaciens C58 and GV3101
      strains. Furthermore, GV3101 DeltamltB3 transforms plants with efficiency
      comparable to that of the wild type but can be cleared with sublethal
      concentrations of ampicillin. The functional characterization of the genes
      involved in the inducible ampicillin resistance pathway of A. tumefaciens
      constitutes a major step forward in efforts to reduce the intrinsic antibiotic
      resistance of this bacterium. IMPORTANCE Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a significant
      biotechnological tool for production of transgenic plant lines, is highly
      resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, posing challenges for various
      applications. One challenge is the efficient elimination of A. tumefaciens from
      transformed plant tissue without using levels of antibiotics that are toxic to
      the plants. Here, we present the functional characterization of genes involved in
      beta-lactam resistance in A. tumefaciens. Knowledge about proteins that promote
      or inhibit beta-lactam resistance will enable the development of strains to
      improve the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformations.
      Effective removal of Agrobacterium from transformed plant tissue has the
      potential to maximize crop yield and food production, improving the outlook for
      global food security.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Reveals the
      Molecular Basis for the Recalcitrant Genetic Transformation of Camellia sinensis 
      L.
LID - 688 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12050688 [doi]
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), an important economic crop, is recalcitrant to
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT), which has seriously hindered the
      progress of molecular research on this species. The mechanisms leading to low
      efficiency of AMT in tea plants, related to the morphology, growth, and gene
      expression of Agrobacterium tumefaciens during tea-leaf explant infection, were
      compared to AMT of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in the present work. Scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that tea leaves induced significant
      morphological aberrations on bacterial cells and affected pathogen-plant
      attachment, the initial step of a successful AMT. RNA sequencing and
      transcriptomic analysis on Agrobacterium at 0, 3 and 4 days after leaf
      post-inoculation resulted in 762, 1923 and 1656 differentially expressed genes
      (DEGs) between the tea group and the tobacco group, respectively. The expressions
      of genes involved in bacterial fundamental metabolic processes, ATP-binding
      cassette (ABC) transporters, two-component systems (TCSs), secretion systems, and
      quorum sensing (QS) systems were severely affected in response to the tea-leaf
      phylloplane. Collectively, these results suggest that compounds in tea leaves,
      especially gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and catechins, interfered with
      plant-pathogen attachment, essential minerals (iron and potassium) acquisition,
      and quorum quenching (QQ) induction, which may have been major contributing
      factors to hinder AMT efficiency of the tea plant.

AB  - Bioluminescence enables the monitoring of spatiotemporal dynamics and activity of
      bacterial populations in planta. We here describe a procedure to use AgroLux, a
      bioluminescent Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as a tool to study bacterial responses 
      upon agroinfiltration. The first method details how to transform bioluminescent
      AgroLux to carry binary plasmids of interests. Then, a simple agroinfiltration
      assay for in planta imaging of bioluminescence signals is presented. AgroLux
      assays will increase our understanding of plant-Agrobacterium interactions and
      plant immunity and improve molecular farming.

AB  - Transient expression of recombinant proteins in plants is being used as a
      platform for production of therapeutic proteins. Benefits of this system include 
      a reduced cost of drug development, rapid delivery of new products to the market,
      and an ability to provide safe and efficacious medicines for diseases. Although
      plant-based production systems offer excellent potential for therapeutic protein 
      production, barriers, such as plant host defense response, exist which negatively
      impact the yield of product. Here we provide a protocol using tandem mass tags
      and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quickly and robustly quantify the
      change in abundance of host defense proteins produced during the production
      process. These proteins can then become candidates for genetic manipulation to
      create host plants with reduced plant defenses capable of producing higher
      therapeutic protein yields.

TI  - Centromere Interactions Promote the Maintenance of the Multipartite Genome in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e0050822
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00508-22 [doi]
AB  - Many pathogens or symbionts of animals and plants contain multiple replicons, a
      configuration called a multipartite genome. Multipartite genomes enable those
      species to replicate their genomes faster and better adapt to new niches. Despite
      their prevalence, the mechanisms by which multipartite genomes are stably
      maintained are poorly understood. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen
      that contains four replicons: a circular chromosome (Ch1), a linear chromosome
      (Ch2), and two large plasmids. Recent work indicates that their replication
      origins are clustered at the cell poles in a manner that depends on their ParB
      family centromeric proteins: ParB1 for Ch1 and individual RepB paralogs for Ch2
      and the plasmids. However, understanding of these interactions and how they
      contribute to genome maintenance is limited. By combining genome-wide chromosome 
      conformation capture (Hi-C) assays, chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing
      (ChIP-seq), and live cell fluorescence microscopy, we provide evidence here that 
      centromeric clustering is mediated by interactions between these centromeric
      proteins. We further show that the disruption of centromere clustering results in
      the loss of replicons. Our data establish the role of centromeric clustering in
      multipartite genome stability. IMPORTANCE About 10% of sequenced bacteria have
      multiple replicons, also known as multipartite genomes. How these multipartite
      genomes are maintained is still poorly understood. Here, we use Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens as a model and show that the replication origins of the four
      replicons are clustered through direct interactions between the centromeric
      proteins; disruption of origin clustering leads to the loss of replicons. Thus,
      our study provided evidence that centromeric clustering is important for
      maintaining multipartite genomes.

TI  - The N-terminal domain of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens telomere resolvase, TelA, 
      regulates its DNA cleavage and rejoining activities.

AB  - Linear replicons can be found in a minority of prokaryotic organisms, including
      Borrelia species and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The problem with replicating the 
      lagging strand end of linear DNAs is circumvented in these organisms by the
      presence of covalently closed DNA hairpin telomeres at the DNA termini. Telomere 
      resolvases are enzymes responsible for generating these hairpin telomeres from a 
      dimeric replication intermediate through a two-step DNA cleavage and rejoining
      reaction referred to as telomere resolution. It was previously shown that the
      agrobacterial telomere resolvase, TelA, possesses ssDNA annealing activity in
      addition to telomere resolution activity. The annealing activity derives,
      chiefly, from the N-terminal domain. This domain is dispensable for telomere
      resolution. In this study, we used activity analyses of an N-terminal domain
      deletion mutant, domain add back experiments, and protein-protein interaction
      studies and we report that the N-terminal domain of TelA is involved in
      inhibitory interactions with the remainder of TelA that are relieved by the
      binding of divalent metal ions. We also found that the regulation of telomere
      resolution by the N-terminal domain of TelA extends to suppression of
      inappropriate enzymatic activity, including hairpin telomere fusion (reaction
      reversal) and recombination between replicated telomeres to form a Holliday
      junction.

TI  - Identification and structural prediction of the unrevealed amidohydrolase enzyme:
      Pterin deaminase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404.
LID - 10.1002/bab.2342 [doi]
AB  - Microbes make a remarkable contribution to the health and well-being of living
      beings all over the world. Interestingly, pterin deaminase is an amidohydrolase
      enzyme that exhibits antitumor, anticancer activities and antioxidant properties.
      With the existing evidence of the presence of pterin deaminase from microbial
      sources, an attempt was made to reveal the existence of this enzyme in the
      unexplored bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404. After, the cells were
      harvested and characterized as intracellular enzymes and then partially purified 
      through acetone precipitation. Subsequently, further purification step was
      carried out with an ion-exchange chromatogram (HiTrap Q FF) using the
      Fast-Protein Liquid Chromatography technique (FPLC). Henceforward, the
      approximate molecular weight of the purified pterin deaminase was determined
      through SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the purified protein was identified accurately by 
      MALDI-TOF, and the sequence was explored through a Mascot search engine.
      Additionally, the three-dimensional structure was predicted and then validated,
      as well as ligand-binding sites, and the stability of this enzyme was confirmed
      for the first time. Thus, the present study revealed the selected parameters
      showing a considerable impact on the identification and purification of pterin
      deaminase from A. tumefaciens LBA4404 for the first time. The enzyme specificity 
      makes it a favorable choice as a potent anticancer agent.

PG  - 830632
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.830632 [doi]
AB  - The natural product 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HA) was firstly isolated from the
      metabolites of Phomopsis liquidambari, one endophytic fungus from Punica granatum
      leaves. The anti-QS potential of HA was evaluated by beta-galactosidase assay and
      acylated homoserine lactones (AHL) analysis. The MIC of HA was > 1.20 mM.
      Exposure to HA at sub-MIC concentrations (0.30-0.60 mM) remarkably reduced the
      beta-galactosidase activity and AHL secretion. Transcriptional analysis by
      qRT-PCR and docking simulation indicated that HA functions as an anti-QS agent by
      inhibiting the transcriptional levels of traI and traR rather than signal
      mimicry. The blocked QS lead to suppressed biofilm formation, motilities, and
      flagella formation after exposure to HA at concentrations ranging from 0.30 to
      0.80 mM. The dysfunctional QS also resulted in repressed antioxidant enzymes and 
      intensified oxidative stress. The intensified oxidative stress destroyed membrane
      integrity, induced energy supply deficiency, resulted in disorder of protein and 
      nuclear acid metabolism, and ultimately weakened pathogenicity of A. tumefaciens.
      HA may have promising potential for controlling A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Transformation of Dunaliella salina by Agrobacterium tumefaciens for the
      Expression of the Hemagglutinin of Avian Influenza Virus H5.
LID - 361 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10020361 [doi]
AB  - Avian influenza (AI) is one of the main threats to the poultry industry
      worldwide. Vaccination efforts are based on inactivated, live attenuated, and
      recombinant vaccines, where the virus hemagglutinin (HA) is the main component of
      any vaccine formulation. This study uses Dunaliella salina to express the AIV HA 
      protein of an H5 virus. D. salina offers a system of feasible culture properties,
      generally recognized as safe for humans (GRAS), with N-glycosylation and nuclear 
      transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The cloning and transformation of D.
      salina cells with the H5HA gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      SDS-PAGE and Western blot confirmed HA5r protein expression, and the correct
      expression and biological activity of the HA5r protein were confirmed by a
      hemagglutination assay (HA). This study proves the feasibility of using a
      different biological system for expressing complex antigens from viruses. These
      findings suggest that a complex protein such as HA5r from AIV (H5N2) can be
      successfully expressed in D. salina.

TI  - Dual adhesive unipolar polysaccharides synthesized by overlapping biosynthetic
      pathways in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1023-1047
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14887 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a member of the Alphaproteobacteria that
      pathogenises plants and associates with biotic and abiotic surfaces via a single 
      cellular pole. A. tumefaciens produces the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) at the
      site of surface contact. UPP production is normally surface-contact inducible,
      but elevated levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate
      (cdGMP) bypass this requirement. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the UPP 
      has a central polysaccharide component. Using an A. tumefaciens derivative with
      elevated cdGMP and mutationally disabled for other dispensable polysaccharides, a
      series of related genetic screens have identified a large number of genes
      involved in UPP biosynthesis, most of which are Wzx-Wzy-type polysaccharide
      biosynthetic components. Extensive analyses of UPP production in these mutants
      have revealed that the UPP is composed of two genetically, chemically, and
      spatially discrete forms of polysaccharide, and that each requires a specific
      Wzy-type polymerase. Other important biosynthetic, processing, and regulatory
      functions for UPP production are also revealed, some of which are common to both 
      polysaccharides, and a subset of which are specific to each type. Many of the UPP
      genes identified are conserved among diverse rhizobia, whereas others are more
      lineage specific.

TI  - Migration of Polyphosphate Granules in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1159/000521970 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens has two polyphosphate (polyP) kinases, one of which
      (PPK1AT) is responsible for the formation of polyP granules, while the other
      (PPK2AT) is used for replenishing the NTP pools by using polyP as a phosphate
      donor to phosphorylate nucleoside diphosphates. Fusions of eYFP with PPK2AT or of
      the polyP granule-associated phosin PptA from Ralstonia eutropha always
      co-localized with polyP granules in A. tumefaciens and allowed the tracking of
      polyP granules in time-lapse microscopy experiments without the necessity to
      label the cells with the toxic dye DAPI. Fusions of PPK1AT with mCherry formed
      fluorescent signals often attached to, but not completely co-localizing with,
      polyP granules in wild-type cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that polyP
      granules in about one-third of a cell population migrated from the old pole to
      the new cell pole shortly before or during cell division. Many cells de novo
      formed a second (nonmigrating) polyP granule at the opposite cell pole before
      cell division was completed, resulting in two daughter cells each having a polyP 
      granule at the old pole after septum formation. Migration of polyP granules was
      disordered in mitomycin C-treated or in PopZ-depleted cells, suggesting that
      polyP granules can associate with DNA or with other molecules that are segregated
      during the cell cycle.

TI  - Conformation and dynamic interactions of the multipartite genome in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
LID - e2115854119 [pii]
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2115854119 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial species from diverse phyla contain multiple replicons, yet how these
      multipartite genomes are organized and segregated during the cell cycle remains
      poorly understood. Agrobacterium tumefaciens has a 2.8-Mb circular chromosome
      (Ch1), a 2.1-Mb linear chromosome (Ch2), and two large plasmids (pAt and pTi). We
      used this alpha proteobacterium as a model to investigate the global organization
      and temporal segregation of a multipartite genome. Using chromosome conformation 
      capture assays, we demonstrate that both the circular and the linear chromosomes,
      but neither of the plasmids, have their left and right arms juxtaposed from their
      origins to their termini, generating interarm interactions that require the
      broadly conserved structural maintenance of chromosomes complex. Moreover, our
      study revealed two types of interreplicon interactions: "ori-ori clustering" in
      which the replication origins of all four replicons interact, and "Ch1-Ch2
      alignment" in which the arms of Ch1 and Ch2 interact linearly along their
      lengths. We show that the centromeric proteins (ParB1 for Ch1 and RepB(Ch2) for
      Ch2) are required for both types of interreplicon contacts. Finally, using
      fluorescence microscopy, we validated the clustering of the origins and observed 
      their frequent colocalization during segregation. Altogether, our findings
      provide a high-resolution view of the conformation of a multipartite genome. We
      hypothesize that intercentromeric contacts promote the organization and
      maintenance of diverse replicons.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric Plasma Corona Discharge on Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      Survival.

AB  - Soil-borne pathogenic microorganisms are known to cause extensive crop losses.
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a member of the Proteobacteria, causes the neoplastic 
      crown gall disease in plants. Plant protection is mainly based on toxic chemicals
      that are harmful to the environment. The use of cold atmospheric-pressure plasma 
      is an attractive method for microbial eradication. Its antimicrobial mechanism
      includes the formation of large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The 
      advantages of eradicating bacteria using cold plasma are not needed for
      chemicals, short treatment, and environmental temperatures. This study examined
      the impact of plasma corona discharge exposure on A. tumefaciens viability,
      membrane permeability, relative cell size, and ROS formation. The results showed 
      that 90 s of plasma exposure led to a reduction by four orders of magnitude when 
      the initial concentration was 1 x 10(7) CFU/mL and in a dry environment. When the
      initial concentration was 1 x 10(6) CFU/mL, 45 s of exposure resulted in total
      bacterial eradication. In a liquid environment, in an initial concentration of
      2.02 x 10(6) CFU/mL, there was no complete bacterial eradication even at the most
      prolonged examined exposure (90 s). The influence of plasma treatment on the
      membrane permeability of A. tumefaciens, and their possible recovery, were
      analyzed using flow cytometer analysis using propidium iodide (PI). When the
      plasma-treated bacteria were suspended in Luria-Bertani (LB) (rich medium), the
      PI-positive count of the plasma-treated bacteria after two hours was 12 +/- 3.9%.
      At the 24th hour, this percentage was only 1.74 +/- 0.6%, as the control (0.7 +/-
      0.1%). These results may indicate the repair of the plasma-treated bacteria that 
      were suspended in LB. At the 24th hour, the relative cell size of the treated
      bacteria shifted to the right, to ~3 x 10(4) forward side scatter (FSC), about
      0.5-fold higher than the untreated cells. Measurement of the ROS showed that the 
      intracellular fluorescence of the 90-s plasma-treated cells led to significant
      fluorescence formation of 32 relative fluorescence units (RFU)/cell (9 x 10(4)
      fold, compared to the nontreated cells). This study showed that cold plasma is a 
      useful method for A. tumefaciens eradication. The eradication mechanism involves 
      ROS generation, membrane permeability, and changes in cell size.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease in
      several plant species by transferring its T-DNA to the host genome. Its
      chemotactic response to a range of chemical compounds released by hosts
      facilitates its colonization to host surfaces, and thus, novel anti-agrobacterium
      compounds are needed to prevent its biofilm formation. Here, we investigated 83
      indole derivatives against A. tumefaciens, and based on the screening,
      4-chloroindole, 6-iodoindole, and 5-chloro-2-methyl indole were selected as
      candidates that at 50 mug mL(-1) significantly inhibited the adherence and
      biofilm formation of A. tumefaciens to abiotic (nitrocellulose and polystyrene)
      and biotic (roots of Brassica juncea) surfaces. Furthermore, they reduced
      bacterial growth in a time and concentration-dependent manner and significantly
      reduced log CFU mL(-1) and survival (%). Changes in biofilm morphologies and
      biomasses, thicknesses, and substratum coverages were determined, and 2-D and 3-D
      analyses were performed using a crystal violet assay and bright field, CLSM, and 
      SEM microscopies. Virulence factors such as swimming motility, exopolysaccharide,
      and exo-protease production, and cell surface hydrophobicity were markedly
      inhibited by the three compounds. Transcriptional analysis showed multi-fold
      downregulation of biofilm, virulence, motility, and stress-related genes;
      however, the degrees of these downregulations were variably affected. B. juncea
      seed germination was only severely affected by 4-chloroindole. This study
      demonstrates the promising antibiofilm and antivirulence activities of the three 
      indole derivatives tested and their potentials for targeting and curbing A.
      tumefaciens infections.

      Detergent-Resistant Membranes.
PG  - 754486

AB  - Cell membranes are not homogenous but compartmentalized into lateral
      microdomains, which are considered as biochemical reaction centers for various
      physiological processes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Due to their special lipid
      and protein composition, some of these microdomains are resistant to treatment
      with non-ionic detergents and can be purified as detergent-resistant membranes
      (DRMs). Here we report the proteome of DRMs from the Gram-negative phytopathogen 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry, we identified proteins enriched in DRMs isolated under normal and
      virulence-mimicking growth conditions. Prominent microdomain marker proteins such
      as the SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflKC) proteins HflK, HflC and
      Atu3772, along with the protease FtsH were highly enriched in DRMs isolated under
      any given condition. Moreover, proteins involved in cell envelope biogenesis,
      transport and secretion, as well as motility- and chemotaxis-associated proteins 
      were overrepresented in DRMs. Most strikingly, we found virulence-associated
      proteins such as the VirA/VirG two-component system, and the membrane-spanning
      type IV and type VI secretion systems enriched in DRMs. Fluorescence microscopy
      of the cellular localization of both secretion systems and of marker proteins was
      in agreement with the results from the proteomics approach. These findings
      suggest that virulence traits are micro-compartmentalized into functional
      microdomains in A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of NHEJ Mutant Aspergillus
      nidulans Conidia: An Efficient Tool for Targeted Gene Recombination Using
      Selectable Nutritional Markers.
LID - 961 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof7110961 [doi]
AB  - Protoplast transformation for the introduction of recombinant DNA into
      Aspergillus nidulans is technically demanding and dependant on the availability
      and batch variability of commercial enzyme preparations. Given the success of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) in diverse pathogenic
      fungi, we have adapted this method to facilitate transformation of A. nidulans.
      Using suitably engineered binary vectors, gene-targeted ATMT of A. nidulans
      non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mutant conidia has been carried out for the
      first time by complementation of a nutritional requirement (uridine/uracil
      auxotrophy). Site-specific integration in the DeltankuA host genome occurred at
      high efficiency. Unlike other transformation techniques, however, cross-feeding
      of certain nutritional requirements from the bacterium to the fungus was found to
      occur, thus limiting the choice of auxotrophies available for ATMT. In
      complementation tests and also for comparative purposes, integration of
      recombinant cassettes at a specific locus could provide a means to reduce the
      influence of position effects (chromatin structure) on transgene expression. In
      this regard, targeted disruption of the wA locus permitted visual identification 
      of transformants carrying site-specific integration events by conidial colour
      (white), even when auxotrophy selection was compromised due to cross-feeding. The
      protocol described offers an attractive alternative to the protoplast procedure
      for obtaining locus-targeted A. nidulans transformants.

LID - 10.1080/12298093.2021.1961431 [doi]
AB  - An endolichenic fungus Xylaria grammica EL000614 produces grammicin, a potent
      nematicidal pyrone derivative that can serve as a new control option for
      root-knot nematodes. We optimized an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) protocol for X. grammica to support genetic studies.
      Transformants were successfully generated after co-cultivation of homogenized
      young mycelia of X. grammica with A. tumefaciens strain AGL-1 carrying a binary
      vector that contains the bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene and
      the eGFP gene in T-DNA. The resulting transformants were mitotically stable, and 
      PCR analysis showed the integratin of both genes in the genome of transformants. 
      Expression of eGFP was confirmed via fluorescence microscopy. Southern analysis
      showed that 131 (78.9%) out of 166 transformants contained a single T-DNA
      insertion. Crucial factors for producing predominantly single T-DNA transformants
      include 48 h of co-cultivation, pre-treatment of A. tumefaciens cells with
      acetosyringone before co-cultivation, and using freshly prepared mycelia. The
      established ATMT protocol offers an efficient tool for random insertional
      mutagenesis and gene transfer in studying the biology and ecology of X. grammica.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is considered a prominent phytopathogen, though most
      isolates are nonpathogenic. Agrobacteria can inhabit plant tissues interacting
      with other microorganisms. Yeasts are likewise part of these communities. We
      analyzed the quorum sensing (QS) systems of A. tumefaciens strain 6N2, and its
      relevance for the interaction with the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, both
      sugarcane endophytes. We show that strain 6N2 is nonpathogenic, produces
      OHC8-HSL, OHC10-HSL, OC12-HSL and OHC12-HSL as QS signals, and possesses a
      complex QS architecture, with one truncated, two complete systems, and three
      additional QS-signal receptors. A proteomic approach showed differences in
      QS-regulated proteins between pure (64 proteins) and dual (33 proteins) cultures.
      Seven proteins were consistently regulated by quorum sensing in pure and dual
      cultures. M. guilliermondii proteins influenced by QS activity were also
      evaluated. Several up- and down- regulated proteins differed depending on the
      bacterial QS. These results show the QS regulation in the bacteria-yeast
      interactions.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) is becoming a popular
      effective system as an insertional mutagenesis tool in filamentous fungi. An
      efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation approach was
      developed for the plant pathogenic fungus, F. oxysporum, the causal agent of
      Apple replant disease (ARD) in China. Four parameters were selected to optimize
      efficiencies of transformation. A. tumefaciens concentration, conidial
      concentration of F. oxysporum, and co-culture temperature and time have a
      significant influence on all parameters. Transformants emit green fluorescence
      under fluorescence microscopy. The integration of a mitotically stable hygromycin
      resistance gene (hph) in the genome is confirmed by PCR. The transformation
      efficiency can reach up to 300 transformants per 10(6) conidia under optimal
      conditions. This ATMT method is an efficient tool for insertional mutagenesis of 
      F. oxysporum.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens fitness genes involved in the colonization of plant
      tumors and roots.
PG  - 905-918
LID - 10.1111/nph.17810 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens colonizes the galls (plant tumors) it causes, and the
      roots of host and nonhost plants. Transposon-sequencing (Tn-Seq) was used to
      discover A.tumefaciens genes involved in reproductive success (fitness genes) on 
      Solanum lycopersicum and Populus trichocarpa tumors and S.lycopersicum and Zea
      mays roots. The identified fitness genes represent 3-8% of A. tumefaciens genes
      and contribute to carbon and nitrogen metabolism, synthesis and repair of DNA,
      RNA and proteins and envelope-associated functions. Competition assays between 12
      knockout mutants and wild-type confirmed the involvement of 10 genes (trpB, hisH,
      metH, cobN, ntrB, trxA, nrdJ, kamA, exoQ, wbbL) in A.tumefaciens fitness under
      both tumor and root conditions. The remaining two genes (fecA, noxA) were
      important in tumors only. None of these mutants was nonpathogenic, but four
      (hisH, trpB, exoQ, ntrB) exhibited impaired virulence. Finally, we used this
      knowledge to search for chemical and biocontrol treatments that target some of
      the identified fitness pathways and report reduced tumorigenesis and impaired
      establishment of A.tumefaciens on tomato roots using tannic acid or Pseudomonas
      protegens, which affect iron assimilation. This work revealed A.tumefaciens
      pathways that contribute to its competitive survival in plants and highlights a
      strategy to identify plant protection approaches against this pathogen.

AB  - Premature leaf fall of apple caused by Marssonina coronaria is economically very 
      important apple disease and all the commercially available apple cultivars are
      susceptible to this disease. The non-availability of an efficient transformation 
      system for this fungus hinders the functional genomics research. Herein, we
      report for the first time, the successful Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
      in apple leaf blotch fungus M. coronaria by transferring T-DNA harbouring the
      genes for hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt), beta-glucuronidase (uidA) and
      green fluorescent protein (gfp) under the control of CaMV 35S promoter. The key
      factors that affect the transformation efficiency including type of recipient
      fungal material, acetosyringone concentration, the conditions for co-cultivation,
      Agrobacterium concentration, Agrobacterium strains and membrane types as support 
      were investigated. The present results have recommended that 250 muM
      concentration of acetosyringone, 24 degrees C temperature and 48 h time, 0.5
      OD600 of A. tumefaciens, EHA105 Agrobacterium strain and Whatman filter paper
      were the optimal co-cultivation conditions for the transformation of M. coronaria
      by using fragmented mycelia suspension and mycelial plugs. We observed that
      conidia were tedious to transform as compared to the fragmented mycelia and
      mycelial plugs of this slow growing fungus. These optimized parameters yielded 54
      and 70 average transformants per 60 mycelial plugs and 10(4) fragmented mycelia, 
      respectively. Fungal transformants were analysed for T-DNA integration, gus gene 
      expression and gfp gene expression. Strong gus histochemical staining and green
      fluorescence expression indicated that the CaMV 35S promoter can drive gene
      expression in M. croronaria. Some mutants showed difference in the morphology of 
      the colony as compared to the wild type control. This report will be very useful 
      to inspect molecular basis of apple-M. coronaria interactions by deciphering the 
      functional roles of various genes in this pathogenic fungus.

AB  - Filamentous fungi are the organisms of choice for most industrial biotechnology. 
      Some species can produce a variety of secondary metabolites and enzymes of
      commercial interest, and the production of valuable molecules has been enhanced
      through different molecular tools. Methods for genetic manipulation and
      transformation have been essential for the optimization of these organisms. The
      genus Simplicillium has attracted increased attention given several potential
      biotechnological applications. The Simplicillium genus harbors several
      entomopathogenic species and some isolates have been explored for bioremediation 
      of heavy metal contaminants. Furthermore, the myriad of secondary metabolites
      isolated from Simplicillium spp. render these organisms as ideal targets for deep
      exploration and further biotechnological mining possibilities. However, the lack 
      of molecular tools hampered the exploration of this genus. Thus, an Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation method was established for Simplicillium
      subtropicum, employing the far-red fluorescent protein TURBOFP635/Katushka, as a 
      visual marker, and the selection marker SUR gene, that confers resistance to
      chlorimuron ethyl. Notably, one round of transformation using the established
      method yielded almost 400 chlorimuron resistant isolates. Furthermore, these
      transformants displayed mitotic stability for, at least, five generations. We
      anticipate that this method can be useful for deep molecular exploration and
      improvement of strains in the Simplicillium genus.

AB  - Many bacteria can migrate from a free-living, planktonic state to an attached,
      biofilm existence. One factor regulating this transition in the facultative plant
      pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI system. Periplasmic ExoR
      regulates the activity of the ChvG-ChvI two-component system in response to
      environmental stress, most notably low pH. ChvI impacts hundreds of genes,
      including those required for type VI secretion, virulence, biofilm formation, and
      flagellar motility. Previous studies revealed that activated ChvG-ChvI represses 
      expression of most of class II and class III flagellar biogenesis genes, but not 
      the master motility regulator genes visN, visR, and rem. In this study, we
      characterized the integration of the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI and VisNR-Rem pathways. We
      isolated motile suppressors of the non-motile DeltaexoR mutant and thereby
      identified the previously unannotated mirA gene encoding a 76 amino acid protein.
      We report that the MirA protein interacts directly with the Rem DNA-binding
      domain, sequestering Rem and preventing motility gene activation. The ChvG-ChvI
      pathway activates mirA expression and elevated mirA is sufficient to block
      motility. This study reveals how the ExoR-ChvG-ChvI pathway prevents flagellar
      motility in A. tumefaciens. MirA is also conserved among other members of the
      Rhizobiales suggesting similar mechanisms of motility regulation.

TI  - Diversification of LytM Protein Functions in Polar Elongation and Cell Division
      of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 729307
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.729307 [doi]
AB  - LytM-domain containing proteins are LAS peptidases (lysostaphin-type enzymes,
      D-Ala-D-Ala metallopeptidases, and sonic hedgehog) and are known to play diverse 
      roles throughout the bacterial cell cycle through direct or indirect hydrolysis
      of the bacterial cell wall. A subset of the LytM factors are catalytically
      inactive but regulate the activity of other cell wall hydrolases and are
      classically described as cell separation factors NlpD and EnvC. Here, we explore 
      the function of four LytM factors in the alphaproteobacterial plant pathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. An LmdC ortholog (Atu1832) and a MepM ortholog
      (Atu4178) are predicted to be catalytically active. While Atu1832 does not have
      an obvious function in cell growth or division, Atu4178 is essential for polar
      growth and likely functions as a space-making endopeptidase that cleaves amide
      bonds in the peptidoglycan cell wall during elongation. The remaining LytM
      factors are degenerate EnvC and NlpD orthologs. Absence of these proteins results
      in striking phenotypes indicative of misregulation of cell division and growth
      pole establishment. The deletion of an amidase, AmiC, closely phenocopies the
      deletion of envC suggesting that EnvC might regulate AmiC activity. The NlpD
      ortholog DipM is unprecedently essential for viability and depletion results in
      the misregulation of early stages of cell division, contrasting with the
      canonical view of DipM as a cell separation factor. Finally, we make the
      surprising observation that absence of AmiC relieves the toxicity induced by dipM
      overexpression. Together, these results suggest EnvC and DipM may function as
      regulatory hubs with multiple partners to promote proper cell division and
      establishment of polarity.

AB  - Dwarf bunt of wheat caused by Tilletia controversa Kuhn has been identified an
      international quarantine disease, which replace the grain material into millions 
      of teliospores. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system
      is a powerful tool for fungi transformation with significant advantages of simple
      operation, high efficiency, and genetic stability of transformants. In this
      study, we constructed ATMT system for T. controversa. All the transformants were 
      tested using Acetosyringone (AS) concentration at 150 mumol/l, hygromycin B at 25
      mug/ml, 1 x 10(6) T. controversa hypha cells/ml, A. tumefaciens with OD600 of 0.5
      co-cultivation at 16 degrees C for 48 h and culture was incubated at 16 degrees C
      for 20 days. Using the ATMT method, we cultivated 8 generations of transformants 
      on complete medium (CM) containing hygromycin B antibiotic and validated by PCR, 
      which indicate that T-DNA had been successfully inserted into each of T.
      controversa transformants. In addition, thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR
      (TAIL-PCR) evaluated the Ti element inserts were at random sites in the fungal
      genome. Thus, ATMT approach is an efficient tool for insertional mutagenesis of
      T. controversa.

TI  - Optimizing the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation conditions in
      Colletotrichum lindemuthianum: a step forward to unravel the functions of
      pathogenicity arsenals.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13552 [doi]
AB  - Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen that causes
      bean anthracnose and it is rated among the top 10 important diseases infecting
      beans. Currently our knowledge on molecular mechanisms underlying C.
      lindemuthianum pathogenesis is limited. About five pathogenicity genes have been 
      identified in C. lindemuthianum using Restricted Enzyme Mediated Integration and 
      the transformation using Agroinfection has not been optimized. In this study, a
      series of experiments were conducted to optimize the key parameters affecting the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation for C. lindemuthianum. The
      transformation efficiency increased with increase in spore concentration and
      co-cultivation time. However, the optimum conditions that yielded significant
      number of transformants were 10(6) ml(-1) spore concentration, co-cultivation
      time of 72 h, incubation at 25 degrees C and using a cellulose membrane filter
      for the co-cultivation. The optimized protocol resulted in establishment of large
      mutant library (2400). A few mutants were melanin deficient and a few were unable
      to produce conidia. To determine the altered pathogenicity, two new approaches
      such as detached leaf and twig techniques proved reliable and require fewer
      resources to screen the large mutant libraries in a short time. Among the 1200
      transformants tested for virulence, 90% transformants were pathogenically similar
      to wild type (race 2047), 96 and 24 were reduced and impaired, respectively. The 
      altered avirulent transformants can prove vital for understanding the missing
      link between growth and developmental stages of pathogen with virulence. This
      platform will help to develop strategies to determine the potential pathogenicity
      genes and to decipher molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in more 
      detail.

TI  - A Sinorhizobium meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens ExoR ortholog is not
      crucial for Brucella abortus virulence.
PG  - e0254568
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0254568 [doi]
AB  - Brucella is a facultative extracellular-intracellular pathogen that belongs to
      the Alphaproteobacteria class. Precise sensing of environmental changes and a
      proper response mediated by a gene expression regulatory network are essential
      for this pathogen to survive. The plant-related Alphaproteobacteria Sinorhizobium
      meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens also alternate from a free to a
      host-associated life, where a regulatory invasion switch is needed for this
      transition. This switch is composed of a two-component regulatory system (TCS)
      and a global inhibitor, ExoR. In B. abortus, the BvrR/BvrS TCS is essential for
      intracellular survival. However, the presence of a TCS inhibitor, such as ExoR,
      in Brucella is still unknown. In this work, we identified a genomic sequence
      similar to S. meliloti exoR in the B. abortus 2308W genome, constructed an exoR
      mutant strain, and performed its characterization through ex vivo and in vivo
      assays. Our findings indicate that ExoR is related to the BvrR phosphorylation
      state, and is related to the expression of known BvrR/BrvS gene targets, such as 
      virB8, vjbR, and omp25 when grown in rich medium or starving conditions. Despite 
      this, the exoR mutant strain showed no significant differences as compared to the
      wild-type strain, related to resistance to polymyxin B or human non-immune serum,
      intracellular replication, or infectivity in a mice model. ExoR in B. abortus is 
      related to BvrR/BvrS as observed in other Rhizobiales; however, its function
      seems different from that observed for its orthologs described in A. tumefaciens 
      and S. meliloti.

TI  - Role of Conformational Change and Glucose Binding Sites in the Enhanced Glucose
      Tolerance of Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A GH1 beta-Glucosidase Mutants.

AB  - beta-Glucosidases are often inhibited by their reaction product glucose and a
      barrier to the efficient lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis to glucose. We had
      previously reported the mutants, C174V, and H229S, with a nearly 2-fold increased
      glucose tolerance over the wild type (WT), H0HC94, encoded in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens 5A (apparent Ki,Glc = 686 mM). We report our steady-state and
      time-resolved intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and
      isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies to further understand increased
      glucose tolerance. Changes in the mutants' emission intensity and the
      differential change in quenching rate in the absence and presence of glucose
      reflect changes in protein conformation by glucose. Time-resolved lifetime and
      anisotropy measurements further indicated the microenvironment differences across
      solvent-exposed tryptophan residues and a higher hydrodynamic radius due to
      glucose binding, respectively. ITC measurements confirmed the increase of glucose
      binding sites in the mutants. The experiment results were supported by molecular 
      dynamics simulations, which revealed significant variations in the
      glucose-protein hydrogen-bonding profiles. Protein structure network analysis of 
      the simulated structures further indicates the mutants' conformation change than 
      the WT. Computational studies also indicated additional glucose binding sites in 
      mutants. Our results indicate the role of glucose binding in modulating the
      enzyme response to glucose.

TI  - An NAD-Specific 6-Hydroxy-3-Succinoyl-Semialdehyde-Pyridine Dehydrogenase from
      Nicotine-Degrading Agrobacterium tumefaciens Strain S33.
PG  - e0092421
LID - 10.1128/Spectrum.00924-21 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain S33 can catabolize nicotine via a hybrid of the 
      pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways. Most of the enzymes involved in this
      biochemical pathway have been identified and characterized, except for the one
      catalyzing the oxidation of 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine to
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine. Based on a previous genomic and transcriptomic
      analysis, an open reading frame (ORF) annotated to encode aldehyde dehydrogenase 
      (Ald) in the nicotine-degrading cluster was predicted to be responsible for this 
      step. In this study, we heterologously expressed the enzyme and identified its
      function by biochemical assay and mass spectrum analysis. It was found that Ald
      catalyzes the NAD-specific dehydrogenation of
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine.
      With the nonhydroxylated analog 3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine (SAP) as a
      substrate, Ald had a specific activity of 10.05 U/mg at pH 9.0 and apparent Km
      values of around 58.68 muM and 0.41 mM for SAP and NAD(+), respectively.
      Induction at low temperature and purification and storage in low-salt buffers
      were helpful to prevent its aggregation and precipitation. Disruption of the ald 
      gene caused a lower growth rate and biomass of strain S33 on nicotine but not on 
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine. Ald has a broad range of substrates, including
      benzaldehyde, furfural, and acetaldehyde. Recombinant Escherichia coli cells
      harboring the ald gene can efficiently convert furfural to 2-furoic acid at a
      specific rate of 0.032 mmol min(-1) g dry cells(-1), extending the application of
      Ald in the catalysis of bio-based furan compounds. These findings provide new
      insights into the biochemical mechanism of the nicotine-degrading hybrid pathway 
      and the possible application of Ald in industrial biocatalysis. IMPORTANCE
      Nicotine is one of the major toxic N-heterocyclic aromatic alkaloids produced in 
      tobacco plants. Manufacturing tobacco and smoking may lead to some environmental 
      and public health problems. Microorganisms can degrade nicotine by various
      biochemical pathways, but the biochemical mechanism for nicotine degradation has 
      not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified an aldehyde dehydrogenase
      responsible for the oxidation of 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine to
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine; this was the only uncharacterized enzyme in the
      hybrid of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
      Similar to the known aldehyde dehydrogenase, the NAD-specific homodimeric enzyme 
      presents a broad substrate range with high activity in alkaline and
      low-salt-containing buffers. It can catalyze not only the aldehyde from nicotine 
      degradation but also those of benzaldehyde, furfural, and acetaldehyde. It was
      found that recombinant Escherichia coli cells harboring the ald gene could
      efficiently convert furfural to valuable 2-furoic acid, demonstrating its
      potential application for enzymatic catalysis.

TI  - First report of Agrobacterium tumefaciens causing crown gall disease of roselle
      (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) in Taiwan.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-21-1007-PDN [doi]
AB  - Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) plants, whose calyces are used for production of
      beverages or jams, are mainly cultivated in Taitung County of eastern Taiwan.
      Since 2016, large crown galls were observed on the roselle plants in the
      commercial plantations at Taimali and Jinfong Townships of Taitung County. A
      follow-up survey in July and August of 2017 revealed spreading of this disease to
      the neighboring areas including Beinan and Dawu Townships. Disease incidence was 
      estimated to be 0.6-10%. Galls of varying sizes (2-15 cm in diameter) were
      usually found on the roots and crowns of the roselle plants, starting with small 
      swellings at the infection sites. Galls were light-colored, and smooth and tender
      in texture at the early stage, but later turned dark-colored, and appeared rough 
      and woody. In some cases, adventitious roots extruding from the larger crown
      galls could be seen. Isolation of the causal agent was performed by quadrantally 
      streaking bacterial suspension made from surface-sterilized, macerated galls on
      trypticase soy agar (TSA). After incubating at 28 degrees C for 5 days, single
      colonies were transferred onto new TSA plates for further cultivation at 28
      degrees C. Finally, circular, convex, viscous and milky white colonies with
      smooth surface similar to colony morphology of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 were
      obtained for further identification. First, all six candidate isolates (TZ-1,
      TL1-2, TL2-1, TD1-1, TD1-24 and TD2-1) were identified as Agrobacterium spp.
      using the partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene (accession numbers MW205820 to
      MW205825 in the GenBank database). The selected isolates also showed some
      biochemical and physiological characteristics similar to A. tumefaciens,
      including oxidase positive, growth at 35 degrees C and in 2% NaCl, and alkalinity
      from litmus milk. Moreover, they were tested negative for utilization of citrate 
      and acid production on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with calcium
      carbonate. Under a transmission electron microscope, the bacterium was rod-shaped
      and possessed peritrichous flagella. By means of multiplex PCR using primers
      designed for differentiation of Agrobacterium rubi, Agrobacterium vitis and
      Agrobacterium biovars 1 and 2, a 184 bp product was detected in all six isolates,
      indicating that they all belong to Agrobacterium biovar 1. Furthermore, the recA 
      allele of each isolate was PCR amplified using primers F2898/F2899, and recA
      sequence analysis assigned all six isolates to A. tumefaciens genomospecies G7
      (GenBank accession numbers MZ570905-MZ570910). Pathogenicity assay was carried
      out by inoculating the stems of 2-week-old roselle seedlings through wounds made 
      with a sterile needle with bacteria on it. The inoculated seedlings were kept in 
      plastic bags to maintain high humidity. Symptoms similar to those observed in the
      field developed at the inoculation sites after 7 days, and Koch's postulates were
      fulfilled when the bacteria re-isolated from the galls were also identified as A.
      tumefaciens genomospecies G7 using recA gene sequence analysis. To our knowledge,
      this is the first report of crown gall disease caused by A. tumefaciens on
      Hibiscus sabdariffa in Taiwan. This disease may potentially damage the roselle
      industry if no action is taken to stop its spreading. Identification of the
      causal agent of roselle crown gall disease could help us further investigate its 
      ecology and develop integrated pest management strategies for prevention of this 
      disease in the future.

AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens atu4217 gene, which encodes a TetR family
      transcription regulator, is a repressor of the atu4218-atu4219-atu4220 operon.
      The Atu4218 and Atu4219 proteins belong to the HlyD family (membrane fusion
      protein) and the AcrB/AcrD/AcrF family (inner membrane transporter),
      respectively, and may form an efflux pump. The atu4220 gene encodes a short-chain
      dehydrogenase. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed induction of atu4217
      and atu4218 by NaOCl but not by N-ethylmaleimide or reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      including H2O2, menadione and cumene hydroperoxide; therefore, the atu4218 and
      atu4219 were named NaOCl-inducible efflux genes nieA and nieB, respectively. The 
      atu4217 gene, which was named nieR, serves as a repressor of nieA and nieB. DNase
      I footprinting assays identified 20-bp imperfect inverted repeat (IR, underlined)
      motifs 5'-TAGATTTAGGATGCAATCTA-3' (box A) and 5'-TAGATTTCACTTGACATCTA-3' (box R) 
      in the intergenic region of the divergent nieA and nieR genes; these motifs were 
      recognized by the NieR protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
      demonstrated that NieR specifically binds to the 20-bp IR motifs and that NaOCl
      prevents this NieR-DNA interaction. Promoter-lacZ fusions and mutagenesis of the 
      NieR boxes (A and R) showed a more dominant role for box A than for box R in the 
      repression of the nieA and nieR promoters. However, full repression of either
      promoter required both operators. The nieR mutant strain exhibited a small colony
      phenotype and was more sensitive than the wild-type to NaOCl and antibiotics,
      including ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and tetracycline. By
      contrast, the nieAB mutant strain showed no phenotype changes under the tested
      conditions.

      and are Involved in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens Infection Process.
PG  - 1572-1588
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcab112 [doi]
AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana small GTP-binding proteins, AtRAB8s, associate with the
      endomembrane system and modulate tubulovesicular trafficking between compartments
      of the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways. There are five members in
      Arabidopsis, namely AtRAB8A-8E. Yeast two-hybrid assays, bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation assays and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays showed that
      RAB8A, 8B and 8D interacted with several membrane-associated reticulon-like
      (AtRTNLB) proteins in yeast, plant cells and in vitro. Furthermore, RAB8A, 8B and
      8D proteins showed interactions with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence
      protein, VirB2, a component of a type IV secretion system (T4SS). A. tumefaciens 
      uses a T4SS to transfer T-DNA and Virulence proteins to plants, which causes
      crown gall disease in plants. The Arabidopsis rab8A, rab8B and rab8D single
      mutants showed decreased levels of Agrobacterium-mediated root and seedling
      transformation, while the RAB8A, 8B and 8D overexpression transgenic Arabidopsis 
      plants were hypersusceptible to A. tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae
      infections. RAB8A-8E transcripts accumulated differently in roots, rosette
      leaves, cauline leaves, inflorescence and flowers of wild-type plants. In
      summary, RAB8A, 8B and 8D interacted with several RTNLB proteins and participated
      in A. tumefaciens and P. syringae infection processes.

TI  - Optimizing Transformation Frequency of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus
      gattii Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - 520 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof7070520 [doi]
AB  - The transformation of Cryptococcus spp. by Agrobacterium tumefaciens has proven
      to be a useful genetic tool. A number of factors affect transformation frequency.
      These factors include acetosyringone concentration, bacterial cell to yeast cell 
      ratio, cell wall damage, and agar concentration. Agar concentration was found to 
      have a significant effect on the transformant number as transformants increased
      with agar concentration across all four serotypes. When infection time points
      were tested, higher agar concentrations were found to result in an earlier
      transfer of the Ti-plasmid to the yeast cell, with the earliest transformant
      appearing two h after A. tumefaciens contact with yeast cells. These results
      demonstrate that A. tumefaciens transformation efficiency can be affected by a
      variety of factors and continued investigation of these factors can lead to
      improvements in specific A. tumefaciens/fungus transformation systems.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Nuclear Transformation of a Biotechnologically
      Important Microalga-Euglena gracilis.
LID - 6299 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms22126299 [doi]
AB  - Euglena gracilis (E. gracilis) is an attractive organism due to its evolutionary 
      history and substantial potential to produce biochemicals of commercial
      importance. This study describes the establishment of an optimized protocol for
      the genetic transformation of E. gracilis mediated by Agrobacterium (A.
      tumefaciens). E. gracilis was found to be highly sensitive to hygromycin and
      zeocin, thus offering a set of resistance marker genes for the selection of
      transformants. A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) yielded
      hygromycin-resistant cells. However, hygromycin-resistant cells hosting the gus
      gene (encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS)) were found to be GUS-negative,
      indicating that the gus gene had explicitly been silenced. To circumvent
      transgene silencing, GUS was expressed from the nuclear genome as transcriptional
      fusions with the hygromycin resistance gene (hptII) (encoding hygromycin
      phosphotransferase II) with the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV)-derived 2A
      self-cleaving sequence placed between the coding sequences. ATMT of Euglena with 
      the hptII-2A-gus gene yielded hygromycin-resistant, GUS-positive cells. The
      transformation was verified by PCR amplification of the T-DNA region genes,
      determination of GUS activity, and indirect immunofluorescence assays.
      Cocultivation factors optimization revealed that a higher number of transformants
      was obtained when A. tumefaciens LBA4404 (A600 = 1.0) and E. gracilis (A750 =
      2.0) cultures were cocultured for 48 h at 19 degrees C in an organic medium (pH
      6.5) containing 50 microM acetosyringone. Transformation efficiency of 8.26 +/-
      4.9% was achieved under the optimized cocultivation parameters. The molecular
      toolkits and method presented here can be used to bioengineer E. gracilis for
      producing high-value products and fundamental studies.

TI  - Effects of Different beta-Lactam Antibiotics on Indirect Tomato (Solanum
      lycopersicum L.) Shoot Organogenesis and Agrobacterium tumefaciens Growth
      Inhibition In Vitro.
LID - 660 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics10060660 [doi]
AB  - A beta-lactams that act by inhibiting the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis are
      one of the most common classes of antibiotics applied to suppress the growth of
      latent bacterial infection associated with the plant tissue culture, as well as
      in the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation techniques. Plant sensitivity to
      antibiotics usually is species-, genotype-, or even tissue-specific and mainly
      depends on concentrations, growth conditions, and culture system. In the
      presented article, we estimated a comparative effect of four beta-lactam
      antibiotics (Claforan((R)), timentin, amoxicillin, and Amoxiclav((R))) at
      different concentrations in an agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture
      medium supplemented with 5 mg L(-1) 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) and 0.1 mg L(-1)
      indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on in vitro callus induction and shoot organogenesis
      from hypocotyl and cotyledon explants of two tomato cultivars (Rekordsmen,
      Moryana). The role of clavulanic acid in combination with amoxicillin
      (Amoxiclav((R))) in the shoot organogenesis frequency and number of shoots per
      explant has been demonstrated. Additionally, the growth inhibition of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens AGL0 strain according to agar disk-diffusion assay was 
      studied. As a result, both stimulatory (timentin, amoxicillin, and
      Amoxiclav((R))) and inhibitory (Claforan((R))) effects of beta-lactam antibiotics
      on in vitro morphogenetic responses of tomato were noted. It was found that
      clavulanic acid, which is part of the commercial antibiotic Amoxiclav((R)),
      significantly increased the shoot regeneration frequency from cotyledon and
      hypocotyl explants of Rekordsmen tomato cultivar. Possible reasons for the
      stimulating effect of clavulanic acid on the induction of shoot organogenesis are
      discussed. According to agar disk-diffusion assay, the maximum diameter of growth
      inhibition zones (43.9 mm) was identified using 200 mg L(-1) timentin. The in
      vitro antibacterial activity of tested beta-lactam antibiotics was arranged in
      the following order: timentin > Claforan((R)) > amoxicillin >/= Amoxiclav((R)).
      Thus, to suppress the growth of internal and latent bacterial infection of tomato
      plant tissue culture, as well as for transformation of Moryana and Rekordsmen
      cultivars by A. tumefaciens strain AGL0, we recommend adding of 100-200 mg L(-1) 
      timentin or 400-800 mg L(-1) Amoxiclav((R)) to the shoot induction medium.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil-borne bacterium that is known for its DNA
      delivery ability and widely exploited for plant transformation. Despite continued
      interest in improving the utility of the organism, the lack of well-characterized
      engineering tools limits the realization of its full potential. Here, we present 
      a synthetic biology toolkit that enables precise and effective control of gene
      expression in A. tumefaciens. We constructed and characterized six inducible
      expression systems. Then, we optimized the one regulated by cumic acid through
      amplifier introduction and promoter engineering and evaluated its 15 cognate
      promoters. To establish fine-tunability, we constructed a series of spacers and a
      promoter library to systematically modulate both translational and
      transcriptional rates. We finally demonstrated the application of the tools by
      co-expressing genes with altered expression levels using a single signal. This
      study provides precise expression tools for A. tumefaciens, facilitating rational
      engineering of the bacterium for advanced plant biotechnological applications.

AB  - Tomato transformation is conventionally performed using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-infected cotyledons. Here, we propose a simple procedure for tomato
      transformation, by which A. tumefaciens cells were smeared onto floral buds of a 
      tomato plant using a paintbrush. Sufficient numbers of fruits were obtained from 
      them, although the smearing of an excess number of A. tumefaciens cells led to an
      adverse effect on the plant growth. Progeny plants were screened by growth on a
      kanamycin-containing selection medium plate. The nptII gene was detected in 10
      plants among 1,599 progenies. These transformants were derived from fruits other 
      than those obtained from the smeared buds. This suggested that A. tumefaciens
      cells moved to the buds located near the smeared buds and caused the
      transformation event. Our findings suggest that this procedure can be used for
      the introduction of a foreign gene into plant cells.

AB  - Ethyl carbamate (EC), widely found in alcoholic beverages, has been revealed to
      be a probable carcinogen in humans. Urethanase (EC 3.5.1.75) is an effective
      enzyme for the degradation of EC; however, the previously identified urethanases 
      exhibited insufficient acid and alcohol resistance. In this study, an
      enantioselective amidase (AmdA) screened from Agrobacterium tumefaciens d3
      exhibited urethanase activity with excellent alcohol resistance. AmdA was first
      overexpressed in Escherichia coli; however, the recombinant protein was primarily
      located in inclusion bodies, and thus, co-expression of molecular chaperones was 
      used. The activity of AmdA increased 3.1 fold to 307 U/L, and the specific
      activity of urethanase with C-terminal His-tags reached 0.62 U/mg after
      purification through a Ni-NTA column. Subsequently, the enzymatic properties and 
      kinetic constants of AmdA were investigated. The optimum temperature for AmdA was
      55 degrees C, it showed the highest activity at pH 7.5, and the Km was 0.964 mM. 
      Moreover, after 1 h of heat treatment at 37 degrees C in a 5-20% (v/v) ethanol
      solution, the residual urethanase activity was higher than 91%, considerably more
      than that reported thus far.

AB  - In this study, the 3-quinuclidinone reductase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      (AtQR) was modified by site-directed mutagenesis. And we further obtained a
      saturation mutant library in which the residue 197 was mutated. A single-point
      mutation converted the wild enzyme that originally had no catalytic activity in
      reduction of ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate (COBE) into an enzyme with catalytic
      activity. The results of enzyme activity assays showed that the seven variants
      could asymmetrically reduce COBE to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate
      ((S)-CHBE) with NADH as coenzyme. In the library, the variant E197N showed higher
      catalytic efficiency than others. The E197N was optimally active at pH 6.0 and 40
      degrees C, and the catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) for COBE was 51.36 s(-1)
      .mM(-1) . This study showed that the substrate specificity of AtQR could be
      changed through site-directed mutagenesis at the residue 197.

      tumefaciens and differential gene expression in dark glands.
PG  - 936-947
LID - 10.1071/FP20292 [doi]
AB  - Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort) is a well-known medicinal plant that
      possesses secondary metabolites with beneficial pharmacological properties.
      However, improvement in the production of secondary metabolites via genetic
      manipulation is a challenging task as H. perforatum remains recalcitrant to
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Here, the transcripts of key
      genes involved in several plant defence responses (secondary metabolites, RNA
      silencing, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and specific defence genes) were
      investigated in H. perforatum suspension cells inoculated with A. tumefaciens by 
      quantitative real-time PCR. Results indicated that key genes from the xanthone,
      hypericin and melatonin biosynthesis pathways, the ROS-detoxification enzyme
      HpAOX, as well as the defence genes Hyp-1 and HpPGIP, were all upregulated to
      rapidly respond to A. tumefaciens elicitation in H. perforatum. By contrast,
      expression levels of genes involved in hyperforin and flavonoid biosynthesis
      pathways were markedly downregulated upon A. tumefaciens elicitation. In
      addition, we compared the expression patterns of key genes in H. perforatum leaf 
      tissues with and without dark glands, a major site of secondary metabolite
      production. Overall, we provide evidence for the upregulation of several
      phenylpropanoid pathway genes in response to elicitation by Agrobacterium,
      suggesting that production of secondary metabolites could modulate H. perforatum 
      recalcitrance to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation.

LID - 1107 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9051107 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a pathogen of various plants which transfers its own
      DNA (T-DNA) to the host plants. It is used for producing genetically modified
      plants with this ability. To control T-DNA transfer to the right place,
      toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems of A. tumefaciens were used to control the target
      site of transfer without any unintentional targeting. Here, we describe a
      toxin-antitoxin system, Atu0939 (mazE-at) and Atu0940 (mazF-at), in the
      chromosome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The toxin in the TA system has 33.3%
      identity and 45.5% similarity with MazF in Escherichia coli. The expression of
      MazF-at caused cell growth inhibition, while cells with MazF-at co-expressed with
      MazE-at grew normally. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that MazF-at
      inhibited protein synthesis by decreasing the cellular mRNA stability. Moreover, 
      the catalytic residue of MazF-at was determined to be the 24th glutamic acid
      using site-directed mutagenesis. From the results, we concluded that MazF-at is a
      type II toxin-antitoxin system and a ribosome-independent endoribonuclease. Here,
      we characterized a TA system in A. tumefaciens whose understanding might help to 
      find its physiological function and to develop further applications.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens Growth Pole Ring Protein: C Terminus and Internal
      Apolipoprotein Homologous Domains Are Essential for Function and Subcellular
      Localization.
LID - e00764-21 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00764-21 [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium growth pole ring (GPR) protein forms a hexameric ring at the
      growth pole (GP) that is essential for polar growth. GPR is large (2,115 amino
      acids) and contains 1,700 amino acids of continuous alpha-helices. To dissect
      potential GPR functional domains, we created deletions of regions with similarity
      to human apolipoprotein A-IV (396 amino acids), itself composed of alpha-helical 
      domains. We also tested deletions of the GPR C terminus. Deletions were inducibly
      expressed as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and tested for
      merodiploid interference with wild-type (WT) GPR function, for partial function
      in cells lacking GPR, and for formation of paired fluorescent foci (indicative of
      hexameric rings) at the GP. Deletion of domains similar to human apolipoprotein
      A-IV in GPR caused defects in cell morphology when expressed in trans to WT GPR
      and provided only partial complementation to cells lacking GPR.
      Agrobacterium-specific domains A-IV-1 and A-IV-4 contain predicted coiled coil
      (CC) regions of 21 amino acids; deletion of CC regions produced severe defects in
      cell morphology in the interference assay. Mutants that produced the most severe 
      effects on cell shape also failed to form paired polar foci. Modeling of A-IV-1
      and A-IV-4 reveals significant similarity to the solved structure of human
      apolipoprotein A-IV. GPR C-terminal deletions profoundly blocked complementation.
      Finally, peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis is abnormally localized circumferentially
      in cells lacking GPR. The results support the hypothesis that GPR plays essential
      roles as an organizing center for membrane and PG synthesis during polar
      growth.IMPORTANCE Bacterial growth and division are extensively studied in model 
      systems (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Caulobacter crescentus) that
      grow by dispersed insertion of new cell wall material along the length of the
      cell. An alternative growth mode-polar growth-is used by some Actinomycetales and
      Proteobacteria species. The latter phylum includes the family Rhizobiaceae, in
      which many species, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens, exhibit polar growth.
      Current research aims to identify growth pole (GP) factors. The Agrobacterium
      growth pole ring (GPR) protein is essential for polar growth and forms a striking
      hexameric ring structure at the GP. GPR is long (2,115 amino acids), and little
      is known about regions essential for structure or function. Genetic analyses
      demonstrate that the C terminus of GPR, and two internal regions with homology to
      human apolipoproteins (that sequester lipids), are essential for GPR function and
      localization to the GP. We hypothesize that GPR is an organizing center for
      membrane and cell wall synthesis during polar growth.

TI  - Tissue Culture- and Selection-Independent Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated
      Transformation of a Recalcitrant Grain Legume, Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.
      Walp).
PG  - 710-718

AB  - A simple and generally fast Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system with no 
      tissue culture and selection steps has been developed for the first time in a
      recalcitrant food legume, cowpea. The approach involves wounding of 1-day-old
      germinated seeds with a needle or sonication either alone or in combination of
      vacuum infiltration with A. tumefaciens EH105 (pCAMBIA2301) carrying a
      beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene (uidA) and a neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII)
      gene for stable transformation. Sonicated and vacuum infiltrated seedlings showed
      the highest transient GUS activity in 90% of the explants. The sprouted
      co-cultured seeds directly established in soil and without selection were allowed
      to develop into plants which on maturity produced T0 seeds. The presence of the
      alien genes, nptII and uidA in T0 plants and their integration into the genome of
      T1 plants were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot
      analyses, respectively. The transgenes were inherited in the subsequent T2
      generation in a Mendelian fashion and their expression was confirmed by
      semi-quantitative PCR. The transformation frequency of 1.90% was obtained with
      sonication followed by vacuum infiltration with Agrobacterium. This approach
      provides favorable circumstances for the rapid meristem transformation and likely
      makes translational research ease in an important recalcitrant food legume,
      cowpea.

TI  - Plant regeneration and transformation of Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens and zygotic embryos.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/s43141-021-00173-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trachyspermum ammi is one of the key medicinal plant species with
      many beneficial properties. Thymol is the most important substance in the
      essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high
      anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest
      research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in
      human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the
      fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this
      plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented
      with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine
      (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and
      kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants. Moreover, two
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (EHA101 and LBA4404) harboring pBI121-TPS2 were
      utilized for genetic transformation to Trachyspermum ammi. RESULTS: According to 
      the obtained results, the highest plant-regeneration frequency was obtained with 
      B5 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA. The integrated gene was
      also approved using the PCR reaction and the Southern blot method. Results also
      showed that the EHA101 strain outperformed another strain in inoculation time (30
      s) and co-cultivation period (1 day) (transformation efficiency 19.29%).
      Furthermore, HPLC method demonstrated that the transformed plants contained a
      higher thymol level than non-transformed plants. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, a
      fast protocol was introduced for the regeneration and transformation of
      Trachyspermum ammi, using zygotic embryo explants in 25-35 days. Our findings
      confirmed the increase in the thymol in the aerial part of Trachyspermum ammi. We
      further presented an efficacious technique for enhancing thymol content in
      Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation system that 
      can be beneficial in genetic transformation and other plant biotechnology
      techniques.

TI  - Co-located quantitative trait loci mediate resistance to Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, Phytophthora cinnamomi, and P. pini in Juglans microcarpa x J. regia
      hybrids.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1038/s41438-021-00546-7 [doi]
AB  - Soil-borne plant pathogens represent a serious threat that undermines commercial 
      walnut (Juglans regia) production worldwide. Crown gall, caused by Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens, and Phytophthora root and crown rots, caused by various Phytophthora
      spp., are among the most devastating walnut soil-borne diseases. A recognized
      strategy to combat soil-borne diseases is adoption of resistant rootstocks. Here,
      resistance to A. tumefaciens, P. cinnamomi, and P. pini is mapped in the genome
      of Juglans microcarpa, a North American wild relative of cultivated walnut.
      Half-sib J. microcarpa mother trees DJUG 31.01 and DJUG 31.09 were crossed with
      J. regia cv. Serr, producing 353 and 400 hybrids, respectively. Clonally
      propagated hybrids were genotyped by sequencing to construct genetic maps for the
      two populations and challenged with the three pathogens. Resistance to each of
      the three pathogens was mapped as a major QTL on the long arm of J. microcarpa
      chromosome 4D and was associated with the same haplotype, designated as haplotype
      b, raising the possibility that the two mother trees were heterozygous for a
      single Mendelian gene conferring resistance to all three pathogens. The
      deployment of this haplotype in rootstock breeding will facilitate breeding of a 
      walnut rootstock resistant to both crown gall and Phytophthora root and crown
      rots.

AB  - The green oleaginous microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana, is a highly productive
      Chlorella species and a potential host for the production of biofuel,
      nutraceuticals, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. The lack of a stable and
      efficient genetic transformation system is the major bottleneck in improving this
      species. We report an efficient and stable Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation system for the first time in C. sorokiniana. Cocultivation of C.
      sorokiniana cells (optical density at lambda 680 = 1.0) with Agrobacterium at a
      cell density of OD600 = 0.6, on BG11 agar medium (pH 5.6) supplemented with 100
      muM of acetosyringone, for three days at 25 +/- 2 degrees C in the dark, resulted
      in significantly higher transformation efficiency (220 +/- 5 hygromycin-resistant
      colonies per 10(6) cells). Transformed cells primarily selected on BG11 liquid
      medium with 30 mg/L hygromycin followed by selecting homogenous transformants on 
      BG11 agar medium with 75 mg/L hygromycin. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of 
      hptII, and the absence of virG amplification ruled out the Agrobacterium
      contamination in transformed microalgal cells. Southern hybridization confirmed
      the integration of the hptII gene into the genome of C. sorokiniana. The qRT-PCR 
      and Western blot analyses confirmed hptII and GUS gene expression in the
      transgenic cell lines. The specific growth rate, biomass doubling time, PSII
      activity, and fatty-acid profile of transformed cells were found similar to
      wild-type untransformed cells, clearly indicating the growth and basic metabolic 
      processes not compromised by transgene expression. This protocol can facilitate
      opportunities for future production of biofuel, carotenoids, nutraceuticals, and 
      therapeutic proteins. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains

TI  - Establishment of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Cladonia
      macilenta, a Model Lichen-Forming Fungus.
LID - 252 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof7040252 [doi]
AB  - Despite the fascinating biology of lichens, such as the symbiotic association of 
      lichen-forming fungi (mycobiont) with their photosynthetic partners and their
      ability to grow in harsh habitats, lack of genetic tools manipulating mycobiont
      has hindered studies on genetic mechanisms underpinning lichen biology. Thus, we 
      established an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system
      for genetic transformation of a mycobiont isolated from Cladonia macilenta. A set
      of combinations of ATMT conditions, such as input biomass of mycobiont,
      co-cultivation period with Agrobacterium cells, and incubation temperature, were 
      tested to identify an optimized ATMT condition for the C. macilenta mycobiont. As
      a result, more than 10 days of co-cultivation period and at least 2 mg of input
      biomass of the mycobiont were recommended for an efficient ATMT, owing to
      extremely slow growth rate of mycobionts in general. Moreover, we examined T-DNA 
      copy number variation in a total of 180 transformants and found that 88% of the
      transformants had a single copy T-DNA insertion. To identify precise T-DNA
      insertion sites that interrupt gene function in C. macilenta, we performed
      TAIL-PCR analyses for selected transformants. A hypothetical gene encoding
      ankyrin repeats at its C-terminus was interrupted by T-DNA insertion in a
      transformant producing dark-brown colored pigment. Although the identification of
      the pigment awaits further investigation, this proof-of-concept study
      demonstrated the feasibility of use of ATMT in construction of a random T-DNA
      insertion mutant library in mycobionts for studying genetic mechanisms behind the
      lichen symbiosis, stress tolerance, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

AB  - This is the first report describing the genetic transformation of Diaporthe
      caulivora, the soybean stem canker fungus. A simple and 100% efficient protocol
      of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation used mycelium as starting
      material and the hygromycin B resistance and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a
      selection and reporter agents, respectively. All transgenic isolates were
      mitotically stable in two independent experiments and polymerase chain reaction
      with hygromycin B resistance primers confirmed successful T-DNA integration into 
      the fungal genome. Plant-fungus interaction studies, including pathogenicity,
      latency, and endophytism, as well as further studies of random and targeted
      mutagenesis will be possible with GFP-expressing isolates of D. caulivora and
      other species in the Diaporthe / Phomopsis complex.

TI  - A LysR-type transcriptional regulator controls the expression of numerous small
      RNAs in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 126-139
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14695 [doi]
AB  - Small RNAs (sRNAs) are universal posttranscriptional regulators of gene
      expression and hundreds of sRNAs are frequently found in each and every
      bacterium. In order to coordinate cellular processes in response to ambient
      conditions, many sRNAs are differentially expressed. Here, we asked how these
      small regulators are regulated using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a model system.
      Among the best-studied sRNAs in this plant pathogen are AbcR1 regulating numerous
      ABC transporters and PmaR, a regulator of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, motility,
      and ampicillin resistance. We report that the LysR-type regulator VtlR (also
      known as LsrB) controls expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. A vtlR/lsrB deletion strain
      showed growth defects, was sensitive to antibiotics and severely compromised in
      plant tumor formation. Transcriptome profiling by RNA-sequencing revealed more
      than 1,200 genes with altered expression in the mutant. Consistent with the
      function of VtlR/LsrB as regulator of AbcR1, many ABC transporter genes were
      affected. Interestingly, the transcription factor did not only control the
      expression of AbcR1 and PmaR. In the mutant, 102 sRNA genes were significantly
      up- or downregulated. Thus, our study uncovered VtlR/LsrB as the master regulator
      of numerous sRNAs. Thereby, the transcriptional regulator harnesses the
      regulatory power of sRNAs to orchestrate the expression of distinct sub-regulons.

TI  - Co-dependent and Interdigitated: Dual Quorum Sensing Systems Regulate Conjugative
      Transfer of the Ti Plasmid and the At Megaplasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      15955.
PG  - 605896
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.605896 [doi]
AB  - Members of the Rhizobiaceae, often carry multiple secondary replicons in addition
      to the primary chromosome with compatible repABC-based replication systems.
      Unlike secondary chromosomes and chromids, repABC-based megaplasmids and plasmids
      can undergo copy number fluctuations and are capable of conjugative transfer in
      response to environmental signals. Several Agrobacterium tumefaciens lineages
      harbor three secondary repABC-based replicons, including a secondary chromosome
      (often linear), the Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid and the At megaplasmid. The Ti
      plasmid is required for virulence and encodes a conjugative transfer (tra) system
      that is strictly regulated by a subset of plant-tumor released opines and a
      well-described acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum-sensing mechanism. The 
      At plasmids are generally not required for virulence, but carry genes that
      enhance rhizosphere survival, and these plasmids are often conjugatively
      proficient. We report that the At megaplasmid of the octopine-type strain A.
      tumefaciens 15955 encodes a quorum-controlled conjugation system that directly
      interacts with the paralogous quorum sensing system on the co-resident Ti
      plasmid. Both the pAt15955 and pTi15955 plasmids carry homologs of a TraI-type
      AHL synthase, a TraR-type AHL-responsive transcription activator, and a TraM-type
      anti-activator. The traI genes from both pTi15955 and pAt15955 can direct
      production of the inducing AHL (3-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone) and together
      contribute to the overall AHL pool. The TraR protein encoded on each plasmid
      activates AHL-responsive transcription of target tra gene promoters. The pAt15955
      TraR can cross-activate tra genes on the Ti plasmid as strongly as its cognate
      tra genes, whereas the pTi15955 TraR is preferentially biased toward its own tra 
      genes. Putative tra box elements are located upstream of target promoters, and
      comparing between plasmids, they are in similar locations and share an inverted
      repeat structure, but have distinct consensus sequences. The two AHL quorum
      sensing systems have a combinatorial effect on conjugative transfer of both
      plasmids. Overall, the interactions described here have implications for the
      horizontal transfer and evolutionary stability of both plasmids and, in a broad
      sense, are consistent with other repABC systems that often have multiple
      quorum-sensing controlled secondary replicons.

TI  - High production of d-psicose from d-fructose by immobilized whole recombinant
      Bacillus subtilis cells expressing d-psicose 3-epimerase from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 364-375
LID - 10.1002/bab.2115 [doi]
AB  - d-Psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase) can catalyze the isomerization of d-fructose to be
      rare sugar d-psicose, which has wide application prospects in the food and
      medical fields. In this study, the DPEase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was
      constructed into plasmid pMA5, and was successfully expressed in the host
      Bacillus subtilis WB600 (B. subtilis). After optimization of the fermentation
      conditions, whole recombinant B. subtilis WB600/pMA5-At-DEPase(O) cells produced 
      d-psicose from d-fructose with a conversion rate of 29.01 +/- 0.19%, which could 
      be used for the efficient synthesis of d-psicose. To further improve the whole
      recombinant B. subtilis application, B. subtilis cells were immobilized onto a
      gel bead biocatalyst by Ca-alginate. After optimization of the biotransformation 
      conditions, the conversion rate of the immobilized biocatalyst reached 20.74 +/- 
      0.39%, which was lower than the free cells. However, the results showed that the 
      immobilized biocatalyst had higher thermal/pH stability and storability, and the 
      gel beads could be recycled for at least six batches. The results showed that the
      amount of d-psicose generated reached 32.83 +/- 2.56 g/L with the immobilized
      biocatalyst after six times biotransformation, whereas the free cells produced
      only approximately 10.44 +/- 0.07 g/L. The results showed that immobilized
      recombinant B. subtilis cells are promising to use for the efficient synthesis of
      d-psicose.

TI  - Rid Enhances the 6-Hydroxypseudooxynicotine Dehydrogenase Reaction in Nicotine
      Degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
LID - e02769-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02769-20 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 degrades nicotine through a hybrid of the pyridine 
      and pyrrolidine pathways. The oxidation of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine to
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine by 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine
      dehydrogenase (Pno) is an important step in the breakdown of the N-heterocycle in
      this pathway. Although Pno has been characterized, the reaction is not fully
      understood; what is known is that it starts at a high speed followed by a rapid
      drop in the reaction rate, leading to the formation of a very small amount of
      product. In this study, we speculated that an unstable imine intermediate that is
      toxic with regard to the metabolism is produced in the reaction. We found that a 
      Rid protein (designated Rid-NC) encoded by a gene in the nicotine-degrading gene 
      cluster enhanced the reaction. Rid is a widely distributed family of small
      proteins with various functions, and some subfamilies have deaminase activity to 
      eliminate the toxicity of the reactive intermediate, imine. Biochemical analyses 
      showed that Rid-NC relieved the toxicity of the presumed imine intermediate
      produced in the Pno reaction and that, in the presence of Rid-NC, Pno maintained 
      a high level of activity and the amount of the reaction product was increase by
      at least 5-fold. Disruption of the rid-NC gene led to slower growth of strain S33
      on nicotine. The mechanism of Rid-NC-mediated detoxification of the imine
      intermediate was discussed. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that Rid-NC belongs
      to the rarely studied Rid6 subfamily. These results further our understanding of 
      the biochemical mechanism of nicotine degradation and provide new insights into
      the function of the Rid6 subfamily proteins.IMPORTANCE Rid is a family of
      proteins that participate in metabolite damage repair and is widely distributed
      in different organisms. In this study, we found that Rid-NC, which belongs to the
      Rid6 subfamily, promoted the 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine dehydrogenase (Pno)
      reaction in the hybrid of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways for nicotine
      degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33. Rid-NC hydrolyzed the presumed
      reactive imine intermediate produced in the reaction to remove its toxicity on
      Pno. The finding furthers our understanding of the metabolic process of the toxic
      N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds in microorganisms. This study demonstrated that
      the Rid family of proteins also functions in the metabolism of N-heterocyclic
      aromatic alkaloids, in addition to the amino acid metabolism, and that
      Rid6-subfamily proteins also have deaminase activity, similar to the RidA
      subfamily. The ability of reactive imines to damage a
      non-pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme was reported. This study provides new
      insights into the function of the Rid family of proteins.

TI  - An Efficient Method for the Genetic Transformation of Acmella oleracea L.
      (Spilanthes acmella Linn.) with Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - 198 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants10020198 [doi]
AB  - Acmella oleracea L. is an important medicinal plant, commonly known as the
      toothache plant. It is a rich source of secondary metabolites used for the
      treatment of different human disorders. The demand for Acmella oleracea L. has
      increased due to its putative health benefits (in terms of both biomass quantity 
      and bioactive compound purification). In vitro plant cultures have allowed the
      rapid increase of raw material availability through the use of suitable
      regeneration and multiplication systems. On the other hand, there is a general
      lack of methods for Acmella genetic transformation as a promising new
      technological approach for the improvement of secondary metabolites. In this
      work, an efficient transformation protocol has been established using the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain bearing the binary vector pBI121
      containing the NPTII gene for the resistance to kanamycin. Plant genetic
      transformation has been verified by direct polymerase chain reaction and GUS
      assay on regenerants. Transformation efficiency has been affected by the high
      level of the selection agent kanamycin. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report on the genetic transformation of A. oleracea, paving the way to further
      studies to improve in vitro plant growth and secondary metabolite production.

AB  - Pomegranate fruit rot caused by Coniella granati is among the most devastating
      diseases threatening pomegranate production. The pathogenic mechanism of this
      pathogen remains largely unknown due to lack of genetic transformation method.
      Herein, we developed an approach to the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) of C. granati using a plasmid vector encoding the green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) and hygromycin resistance (Hyg) genes. This approach
      yielded C. granati transformants that exhibited uniform, stable green
      fluorescence. We further optimized this ATMT protocol, enabling us to achieve a
      transformation efficiency of up to 300 transformants per 0.5 cm(2) mycelial plug.
      Together, we thus provide the first report of the stable transformation of C.
      granati, laying a foundation for future functional studies characterizing this
      economically important fungal pathogen.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 technique for rice genome engineering is gaining momentum and
      requires a precise gene delivery system. For rice and other crop plants,
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) is considered a suitable 
      gene transformation method. The AMT for indica-type rice is a challenge because
      it is less efficient in tissue culture response than japonica-type rice. Here is 
      a protocol of the AMT method that we developed for IR64 variety which has been
      successfully tested in other popular indica-type rice varieties. We used
      embryogenic calli as explant and an empty gRNA-containing CRISPR/Cas9 vector with
      hptII (hygromycin phosphotransferase) gene for the transformation. This technique
      would speed up rice genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 technology and facilitate to
      achieve varied application in the future.

AB  - Beneficial rhizobacteria can inhibit soilborne pathogens by secreting an array of
      polyketides, lipopeptides and dipeptides, but the effect of polyketides on crown 
      gall disease caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 is unclear. In this study,
      the antagonistic compounds of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus 
      velezensis CLA178 was sorted with different organic phases, purified by
      high-pressure liquid chromatography, and detected by a liquid chromatography
      ionization-mass spectrometry system. Macrolactins were found to be the compounds 
      with antagonistic activity against A. tumefaciens C58. When the macrolactin
      synthesis pathway was disrupted, the mutant big up tri, openmlnA only showed
      slight antagonistic activity against A. tumefaciens C58. Transmission electron
      microscopy showed that the inhibition of C58 cell division by cell-free culture
      from the mutant big up tri, openmlnA was weaker than that by cell-free culture
      from CLA178. The mutant deficient in production of macrolactin showed a weaker
      transcription of genes involved in attachment of C58 to plant and lower
      biocontrol of crown gall disease in rose than the wild-type strain CLA178. The
      effect of macrolactins on pathogen C58 has been also confirmed by the purified
      macrolactins. These results reveal that macrolactins contribute to the biocontrol
      activity of C58 by inhibiting cell division and downregulating the transcription 
      of chvB and chvE.

AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease and is a
      widely used tool for generating transgenic plants owing to its virulence. The
      pathogenic process involves a shift from an independent to a living form within a
      host plant. However, comprehensive analyses of metabolites, genes, and reactions 
      contributing to this complex process are lacking. To gain new insights about the 
      pathogenicity from the viewpoints of physiology and cellular metabolism, a
      genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) was reconstructed for A. tumefaciens. The
      model, referred to as iNX1344, contained 1,344 genes, 1,441 reactions, and 1,106 
      metabolites. It was validated by analyses of in silico cell growth on 39 unique
      carbon or nitrogen sources and the flux distribution of carbon metabolism. A.
      tumefaciens metabolic characteristics under three ecological niches were
      modelled. A high capacity to access and metabolize nutrients is more important
      for rhizosphere colonization than in the soil, and substantial metabolic changes 
      were detected during the shift from the rhizosphere to tumour environments.
      Furthermore, by integrating transcriptome data for tumour conditions, significant
      alterations in central metabolic pathways and secondary metabolite metabolism
      were identified. Overall, the GSMM and constraint-based analysis could decode the
      physiological and metabolic features of A. tumefaciens as well as interspecific
      interactions with hosts, thereby improving our understanding of host adaptation
      and infection mechanisms.

AB  - The impact of 1-(4-amino-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone (AHPE) from the metabolites of 
      endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari on quorum sensing (QS) of Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens was evaluated for the first time in this study. Exposure to AHPE at
      concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 50 mug/mL, the beta-galactosidase activity,
      acyl-homoserine lactone level, swimming motility, chemotaxis, and flagella
      formation were significantly inhibited. qRT-PCR quantification combined with the 
      docking analysis demonstrated that AHPE affected the QS system of A. tumefaciens 
      by repressing the transcriptional levels of traI and traR rather than signal
      mimicry. (1)H NMR-based metabolic analysis indicated that the metabolism of A.
      tumefaciens was notably disturbed with AHPE treatment. AHPE treatment also
      resulted in the enhanced oxidative stress in A. tumefaciens. The enhanced
      oxidative stress lead to the disorder of energy supply, protein synthesis, and
      nucleotide metabolism, and ultimately attenuated the pathogenicity of A.
      tumefaciens. Our study indicated that AHPE can serve as a potential pesticide to 
      defend against A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated in planta transformation strategy for
      development of transgenics in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with GFP as a visual
      marker.

AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), a mercantile crop plant, is grown worldwide for
      fiber and seed oil. As with other economically important crops, cotton is bogged 
      down with many biotic and abiotic stress factors. Towards this, genetic
      engineering offers numerous protocols to engineer plants for better resilience.
      However, recalcitrance of cotton to plant tissue culture has been the major
      constraint for successful in vitro regeneration. Hence, alternate methods that
      evade tissue culture regeneration have been envisaged. Non tissue culture-based
      in planta transformation strategies are in vogue due to amenability and ease in
      the generation of transgenic plants. In the present study, we demonstrate the
      utility of an in planta transformation protocol and establishment of a stringent 
      selection agent-based screening for the identification of transgenics. The
      genotype independent nature of the protocol was validated in cotton cv. Pusa 8-6 
      using GFP. Preliminary transformation efficiency of 28% was achieved with a
      screening efficiency of 20% in the presence of hygromycin. The proof of T-DNA
      integration by various molecular and expression analysis in T1 and T2 generations
      proved that this technique can be employed to generate transgenic cotton.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Fonsecaea monophora and
      Fonsecaea erecta for Host-Environment Interaction Studies.
LID - E325 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof6040325 [doi]
AB  - The fungal genus Fonsecaea contains etiological agents of human
      chromoblastomycosis, a (sub)tropical, (sub)cutaneous implantation disease caused 
      by plant contact. The invasive potential differs significantly between species.
      Infections by Fonsecaea monophora are believed to originate from the environment 
      and the species has been reported as one of the main causative agents of the
      disease, but also of cases of primary brain infection. The epidemiology of the
      disease has not been fully elucidated and questions related to its infection
      route and virulence are still to be clarified. The environmental species
      Fonsecaea erecta was isolated from organic material and living plants in endemic 
      areas for chromoblastomycosis in Brazil. The present paper describes
      Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) of the environmental
      species F. erecta and the pathogenic species F. monophora. We propose the use of 
      Agrobacterium transformation for future gene function studies related to
      Fonsecaea virulence and pathogenicity. We evaluated the co-cultivation ratios
      1:1, 10:1 and 100:1 (Agrobacterium:conidia) at 28 degrees C during 72 h. pAD1625 
      and pCAMDsRed plasmids were inserted into both species. Confirmation of
      transformation was realized by hph gene amplification and Southern blot
      determined the amount of foreign DNA integrated into the genome. In order to
      evaluate a potential link between environmental and clinical strains, we obtained
      red fluorescent transformants after pCAMDsRed insertion. We observed by confocal 
      fluorescence microscopy that both F. monophora and F. erecta were able to
      colonize the palm Bactris gasipaes, penetrating the epidermis. These results
      contribute to understanding the ability of Fonsecaea species to adapt to
      different environmental and host conditions.

TI  - Targeted Disruption of Scytalone Dehydratase Gene Using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation Leads to Altered Melanin Production in
      Ascochyta lentis.
LID - E314 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jof6040314 [doi]
AB  - Sustainable crop production is constantly challenged by the rapid evolution of
      fungal pathogens equipped with an array of host infection strategies and survival
      mechanisms. One of the devastating fungal pathogens that infect lentil is the
      ascomycete Ascochyta lentis which causes black spot or ascochyta blight (AB) on
      all above ground parts of the plant. In order to explore the mechanisms involved 
      in the pathogenicity of A. lentis, we developed a targeted gene replacement
      method using Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT) to study
      and characterize gene function. In this study, we investigated the role of
      scytalone dehydratase (SCD) in the synthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene
      (DHN)-melanin in AlKewell. Two SCD genes have been identified in AlKewell, AlSCD1
      and AlSCD2. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AlSCD1 clustered with the
      previously characterized fungal SCDs; thus, AlSCD1 was disrupted using the
      targeted gene replacement vector, pTAR-hyg-SCD1. The vector was constructed in a 
      single step process using Gibson Assembly, which facilitated an easy and seamless
      assembly of multiple inserts. The resulting AlKewell scd1::hyg transformants
      appeared light brown/brownish-pink in contrast to the dark brown pycnidia of the 
      WT strain and ectopic transformant, indicating an altered DHN-melanin production.
      Disruption of AlSCD1 gene did not result in a change in the virulence profile of 
      AlKewell towards susceptible and resistant lentil varieties. This is the first
      report of a targeted gene manipulation in A. lentis which serves as a foundation 
      for the functional gene characterization to provide a better understanding of
      molecular mechanisms involved in pathogen diversity and host specificity.

TI  - Strategies to produce T-DNA free CRISPRed fruit trees via Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens stable gene transfer.
PG  - 20155
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-77110-1 [doi]
AB  - Genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful technology, which has been widely
      applied to improve traits in cereals, vegetables and even fruit trees. For the
      delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components into dicotyledonous plants, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens mediated gene transfer is still the prevalent method, although
      editing is often accompanied by the integration of the bacterial T-DNA into the
      host genome. We assessed two approaches in order to achieve T-DNA excision from
      the plant genome, minimizing the extent of foreign DNA left behind. The first is 
      based on the Flp/FRT system and the second on Cas9 and synthetic cleavage target 
      sites (CTS) close to T-DNA borders, which are recognized by the sgRNA. Several
      grapevine and apple lines, transformed with a panel of CRISPR/SpCas9 binary
      vectors, were regenerated and characterized for T-DNA copy number and for the
      rate of targeted editing. As detected by an optimized NGS-based sequencing
      method, trimming at T-DNA borders occurred in 100% of the lines, impairing in
      most cases the excision. Another observation was the leakage activity of Cas9
      which produced pierced and therefore non-functional CTS. Deletions of genomic DNA
      and presence of filler DNA were also noticed at the junctions between T-DNA and
      genomic DNA. This study proved that many factors must be considered for designing
      efficient binary vectors capable of minimizing the presence of exogenous DNA in
      CRISPRed fruit trees.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens Deploys a Versatile Antibacterial Strategy To Increase 
      Its Competitiveness.
LID - e00490-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00490-20 [doi]
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread antibacterial weapon capable 
      of secreting multiple effectors for inhibition of competitor cells. Most of the
      effectors in the system share the same purpose of target intoxication, but the
      rationale for maintaining various types of effectors in a species is not well
      studied. In this study, we showed that a peptidoglycan amidase effector in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Tae, cleaves d-Ala-meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDAP) and
      d-Glu bonds in peptidoglycan and is able to suppress the growth of Escherichia
      coli recipient cells. The growth suppression was effective only under the
      condition in which E. coli cells are actively growing. In contrast, the Tde DNase
      effectors in the strain possessed a dominant killing effect under carbon
      starvation. Microscopic analysis showed that Tde triggers cell elongation and DNA
      degradation, while Tae causes cell enlargement without DNA damage in E. coli
      recipient cells. In a rich medium, A. tumefaciens harboring only functional Tae
      was able to maintain competitiveness among E. coli and its own sibling cells.
      Growth suppression and the competitive advantage of A. tumefaciens were abrogated
      when recipient cells produced the Tae-specific immunity protein Tai. Given that
      Tae is highly conserved among A. tumefaciens strains, the combination of Tae and 
      Tde effectors could allow A. tumefaciens to better compete with various
      competitors by increasing its survival during changing environmental
      conditions.IMPORTANCE The T6SS encodes multiple effectors with diverse functions,
      but little is known about the biological significance of harboring such a
      repertoire of effectors. We reported that the T6SS antibacterial activity of the 
      plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be enhanced under carbon starvation 
      or when recipient cell wall peptidoglycan is disturbed. This led to a newly
      discovered role for the T6SS peptidoglycan amidase Tae effector in providing a
      growth advantage dependent on the growth status of the target cell. This is in
      contrast to the Tde DNase effectors that are dominant during carbon starvation.
      Our study suggests that combining Tae and other effectors could allow A.
      tumefaciens to increase its competitiveness among changing environmental
      conditions.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Genetic Transformation of the
      Ect-endomycorrhizal Fungus Terfezia boudieri.
LID - E1293 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes11111293 [doi]
AB  - Mycorrhizal desert truffles such as Terfezia boudieri, Tirmania nivea, and
      Terfezia claveryi, form mycorrhizal associations with plants of the Cistaceae
      family. These valued truffles are still collected from the wild and not
      cultivated under intensive farming due to the lack of basic knowledge about their
      biology at all levels. Recently, several genomes of desert truffles have been
      decoded, enabling researchers to attempt genetic manipulations to enable
      cultivation. To execute such manipulations, the development of molecular tools
      for genes transformation into truffles is needed. We developed an Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation system in T. boudieri. This system
      was optimized for the developmental stage of the mycelia explants, bacterial
      optical density, infection and co-cultivation durations, and concentrations of
      the selection antibiotics. The pFPL-Rh plasmid harboring hph gene conferring
      hygromycin resistance as a selection marker and the red fluorescent protein gene 
      were used as visual reporters. The optimal conditions were incubation with 200
      muM of acetosyringone, attaining a bacterial optical density of 0.3 OD600;
      transfer time of 45 min; and co-cultivation for 3 days. This is the first report 
      on a transformation system for T. boudieri, and the proposed protocol can be
      adapted for the transformation of other important desert truffles as well as
      ectomycorrhizal species.

TI  - Improving T-DNA Transfer to Tamarix hispida by Adding Chemical Compounds During
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens Culture.
PG  - 501358
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2020.501358 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer is the most commonly used method
      for plant genetic engineering. However, during the period of A. tumefaciens
      culture, the effects of Agrobacterium culture before inoculation on genetic
      transformation are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the
      factors that affect the genetic transformation efficiency during Agrobacterium
      culture using Tamarix hispida as transgenic plant material. Agrobacterium
      treatment with spermidine (Spe), azacitidine (5-AzaC), dithiothreitol (DTT), or
      acetosyringone (AS) alone all significantly improved the efficiency of T-DNA
      transfer. Treatment with 5-AzaC reduced DNA methylation in Agrobacterium to
      induce the expression of virulence (vir) family genes, including virA, virB1,
      virC1, virD2, virD4 virE2, and virG. Spe treatment significantly induced the
      expression of all the studied genes, including virA, virB1, virC1, virD1, virD2, 
      virD4, virE2, and virG. DTT treatment decreased reactive oxygen species
      accumulation. AS treatment activated the expression of the genes virA, virB1,
      virC1, virD1, virD2, virD4 and virG. All these effects resulted in increased
      T-DNA transfer. Additionally, combined Spe, 5-AzaC, DTT, and AS treatment improve
      Agrobacterium infection to a greater extent compared with their use alone,
      increasing T-DNA transfer by more than 8-fold relative to no treatment.
      Therefore, to improve genetic transformation, pretreatment of Agrobacterium
      during the culture period is important for improving genetic transformation
      efficiency.

TI  - In silico analysis of the chemotactic system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000460 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is an efficient tool for creating transgenic host
      plants. The first step in the genetic transformation process involves A.
      tumefaciens chemotaxis, which is crucial to the survival of A. tumefaciens in
      changeable, harsh and even contaminated soil environments. However, a systematic 
      study of its chemotactic signalling pathway is still lacking. In this study, the 
      distribution and classification of chemotactic genes in the model A. tumefaciens 
      C58 and 21 other strains were annotated. Local blast was used for comparative
      genomics, and hmmer was used for predicting protein domains. Chemotactic
      phenotypes for knockout mutants of ternary signalling complexes in A. tumefaciens
      C58 were evaluated using a swim agar plate. A major cluster, in which chemotaxis 
      genes were consistently organized as MCP (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein),
      CheS, CheY1, CheA, CheR, CheB, CheY2 and CheD, was found in A. tumefaciens, but
      two coupling CheW proteins were located outside the 'che' cluster. In the ternary
      signalling complexes, the absence of MCP atu0514 significantly impaired A.
      tumefaciens chemotaxis, and the absence of CheA (atu0517) or the deletion of both
      CheWs abolished chemotaxis. A total of 465 MCPs were found in the 22 strains, and
      the cytoplasmic domains of these MCPs were composed of 38 heptad repeats. A high 
      homology was observed between the chemotactic systems of the 22 A. tumefaciens
      strains with individual differences in the gene and receptor protein
      distributions, possibly related to their ecological niches. This preliminary
      study demonstrates the chemotactic system of A. tumefaciens, and provides some
      reference for A. tumefaciens sensing and chemotaxis to exogenous signals.

TI  - Arginine-Rich Small Proteins with a Domain of Unknown Function, DUF1127, Play a
      Role in Phosphate and Carbon Metabolism of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e00309-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00309-20 [doi]
AB  - In any given organism, approximately one-third of all proteins have a yet-unknown
      function. A widely distributed domain of unknown function is DUF1127.
      Approximately 17,000 proteins with such an arginine-rich domain are found in
      4,000 bacteria. Most of them are single-domain proteins, and a large fraction
      qualifies as small proteins with fewer than 50 amino acids. We systematically
      identified and characterized the seven DUF1127 members of the plant pathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens They all give rise to authentic proteins and are
      differentially expressed as shown at the RNA and protein levels. The seven
      proteins fall into two subclasses on the basis of their length, sequence, and
      reciprocal regulation by the LysR-type transcription factor LsrB. The absence of 
      all three short DUF1127 proteins caused a striking phenotype in later growth
      phases and increased cell aggregation and biofilm formation. Protein profiling
      and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the wild type and triple
      mutant revealed a large number of differentially regulated genes in late
      exponential and stationary growth. The most affected genes are involved in
      phosphate uptake, glycine/serine homeostasis, and nitrate respiration. The
      results suggest a redundant function of the small DUF1127 paralogs in nutrient
      acquisition and central carbon metabolism of A. tumefaciens They may be required 
      for diauxic switching between carbon sources when sugar from the medium is
      depleted. We end by discussing how DUF1127 might confer such a global impact on
      cell physiology and gene expression.IMPORTANCE Despite being prevalent in
      numerous ecologically and clinically relevant bacterial species, the biological
      role of proteins with a domain of unknown function, DUF1127, is unclear.
      Experimental models are needed to approach their elusive function. We used the
      phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a natural genetic engineer that causes
      crown gall disease, and focused on its three small DUF1127 proteins. They have
      redundant and pervasive roles in nutrient acquisition, cellular metabolism, and
      biofilm formation. The study shows that small proteins have important previously 
      missed biological functions. How small basic proteins can have such a broad
      impact is a fascinating prospect of future research.

TI  - An effective method for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of
      Jatropha curcas L. using cotyledon explants.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is one of oilseed crops and has been considered as an energy
      crop. In the present study, efficient plant regeneration protocol and
      transformation method were developed for J. curcas. Because the regeneration
      efficiency of adventitious bud from cotyledon explants of J. curcas induced by
      traditional methods is low, and it takes a long time to get complete plants. It
      is necessary to establish a new regeneration system to improve regeneration
      efficiency. Cotyledon explants were dipped into TDZ solution at different
      concentrations respectively for various times to obtain higher efficiency of
      adventitious bud regeneration. This new regeneration method was then applied to
      genetic transformation of J. curcas. Cotyledon explants were precultured for 1
      day after treated with high concentration of Thidiazuron (TDZ) solution (20 mg/L 
      for 40 min), followed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection. After co-cultured
      for 2 days, the explants were placed on the induction hormone-free media for bud 
      regeneration and resistant screening. After 30 days, selected shoot buds were
      transferred onto elongation medium for 15 days. Young leaf sections of the
      regenerated shoots were used for PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) detection of the
      transgenic shoots. The PCR positive shoots were isolated and used for in vitro
      grafting. The intact plants were obtained within 20 days. GUS (beta-Glucosidase) 
      staining and Southern analysis confirmed the transformation events. Briefly, a
      transformation efficiency of 34.32% was achieved and an intact transgenic plant
      could be obtained within 65 days.

TI  - Efficient expressions of reporter genes in the industrial filamentous fungus
      Sclerotium rolfsii mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

AB  - Sclerotium rolfsii (teleomorph Athelia rolfsii) is one of the plant pathogenic
      basidiomycetes, which causes severe stem-rot disease in hundreds of plants and
      produces important metabolites, such as scleroglucan and TF-specific lectin.
      However, further molecular biological research on this filamentous fungus is
      severely plateaued out due to the lack of genetic methods. In this study, the A. 
      tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring a binary vector containing the basta
      resistance gene fused with three reporters (DsRed, tdTomato, and GUSPlus)
      respectively, driven by the SrGPD promoter, was used for genetic transformation
      of S. rolfsii. The results showed that the three reporter genes were all
      effectively expressed in S. rolfsii. This study also showed that the intron of
      the SrGPD promoter is not necessary for transgene expression in this fungus.
      Besides, we showed that these reporters' signals could be observed easily but in 
      a short time window. The efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system
      and the three reporter gene plasmids for S. rolfsii developed in this study are
      of significance in overcoming current limitations of no available transformation 
      and genetic manipulation techniques in S. rolfsii, facilitating further genetic
      manipulations and gene function exploration.

TI  - Characterization of Agrobacterium tumefaciens PPKs reveals the formation of
      oligophosphorylated products up to nucleoside nona-phosphates.
PG  - 9683-9692
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10891-7 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens synthesizes polyphosphate (polyP) in the form of one or
      two polyP granules per cell during growth. The A. tumefaciens genome codes for
      two polyphosphate kinase genes, ppk1AT and ppk2AT, of which only ppk1AT is
      essential for polyP granule formation in vivo. Biochemical characterization of
      the purified PPK1AT and PPK2AT proteins revealed a higher substrate specificity
      of PPK1AT (in particular for adenine nucleotides) than for PPK2AT. In contrast,
      PPK2AT accepted all nucleotides at comparable rates. Most interestingly, PPK2AT
      catalyzed also the formation of tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and
      octa-phosphorylated nucleosides from guanine, cytosine, desoxy-thymidine, and
      uridine nucleotides and even nona-phosphorylated adenosine. Our data-in
      combination with in vivo results-suggest that PPK1AT is important for the
      formation of polyP whereas PPK2AT has the function to replenish nucleoside
      triphosphate pools during times of enhanced demand. The potential physiological
      function(s) of the detected oligophosphorylated nucleotides await clarification. 
      KEY POINTS: *PPK1AT and PPK2AT have different substrate specificities, *PPK2AT is
      a subgroup 1 member of PPK2s, *PPK2AT catalyzes the formation of
      polyphosphorylated nucleosides.

TI  - Segregation of four Agrobacterium tumefaciens replicons during polar growth: PopZ
      and PodJ control segregation of essential replicons.
PG  - 26366-26373
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2014371117 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 contains four replicons, circular chromosome (CC), 
      linear chromosome (LC), cryptic plasmid (pAt), and tumor-inducing plasmid (pTi), 
      and grows by polar growth from a single growth pole (GP), while the old cell
      compartment and its old pole (OP) do not elongate. We monitored the replication
      and segregation of these four genetic elements during polar growth. The three
      largest replicons (CC, LC, pAt) reside in the OP compartment prior to
      replication; post replication one copy migrates to the GP prior to division. CC
      resides at a fixed location at the OP and replicates first. LC does not stay
      fixed at the OP once the cell cycle begins and replicates from varied locations
      20 min later than CC. pAt localizes similarly to LC prior to replication, but
      replicates before the LC and after the CC. pTi does not have a fixed location,
      and post replication it segregates randomly throughout old and new cell
      compartments, while undergoing one to three rounds of replication during a single
      cell cycle. Segregation of the CC and LC is dependent on the GP and OP identity
      factors PopZ and PodJ, respectively. Without PopZ, replicated CC and LC do not
      efficiently partition, resulting in sibling cells without CC or LC. Without PodJ,
      the CC and LC exhibit abnormal localization to the GP at the beginning of the
      cell cycle and replicate from this position. These data reveal PodJ plays an
      essential role in CC and LC tethering to the OP during early stages of polar
      growth.

TI  - Overexpression of polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) gene from Hypericum
      perforatum alters expression of multiple defense-related genes and modulates
      recalcitrance to Agrobacterium tumefaciens in tobacco.

AB  - Hypericum perforatum L is a remarkable source of high-value secondary metabolites
      with increasing applications in pharmaceutical industry. However, improvement in 
      the production of secondary metabolites through genetic engineering is a
      demanding task, as H. perforatum is not amenable to Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation. In this study, we identified a
      Polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) gene from a subtractive cDNA library 
      of A. tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of HpPGIP in
      defense against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum
      overexpressing HpPGIP alone or fused at the N-terminus to Phenolic oxidative
      coupling protein (Hyp-1), a gene that positively modulates resistance to A.
      tumefaciens. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing was employed to knock down
      the expression of the PGIP homologous in N. benthamiana. Results showed that
      Agrobacterium-mediated expression efficiency greatly decreased in both HpPGIP and
      Hyp-1-PGIP transgenic plants, as assessed by GUS staining assays. However,
      silencing of PGIP in N. benthamiana increased the resistance to A. tumefaciens
      rather than susceptibility, which correlated with induction of
      pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs). The expression of core genes involved in
      several defense pathways was also analyzed in transgenic tobacco plants.
      Overexpression of HpPGIP led to up-regulation of key genes involved in hormone
      signaling, microRNA-based gene silencing, homeostasis of reactive oxygen species,
      and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Overexpression of Hyp-1-PGIP seemed to enhance
      the effect of PGIP on the expression of most genes analyzed. Moreover, HpPGIP was
      detected in the cytoplasm, nucleus and the plasma membrane or cell wall by
      confocal microscopy. Overall, our findings suggest HpPGIP modulates recalcitrance
      to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum.

TI  - A central role for the transcriptional regulator VtlR in small RNA-mediated gene 
      regulation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 14968
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-72117-0 [doi]
AB  - LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) are the most common type of
      transcriptional regulators in prokaryotes and function by altering gene
      expression in response to environmental stimuli. In the class
      Alphaproteobacteria, a conserved LTTR named VtlR is critical to the establishment
      of host-microbe interactions. In the mammalian pathogen Brucella abortus, VtlR is
      required for full virulence in a mouse model of infection, and VtlR activates the
      expression of abcR2, which encodes a small regulatory RNA (sRNA). In the plant
      symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti, the ortholog of VtlR, named LsrB, is involved in
      the symbiosis of the bacterium with alfalfa. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a close
      relative of both B. abortus and S. meliloti, and this bacterium is the causative 
      agent of crown gall disease in plants. In the present study, we demonstrate that 
      VtlR is involved in the ability of A. tumefaciens to grow appropriately in
      artificial medium, and an A. tumefaciens vtlR deletion strain is defective in
      motility, biofilm formation, and tumorigenesis of potato discs. RNA-sequencing
      analyses revealed that more than 250 genes are dysregulated in the vtlR strain,
      and importantly, VtlR directly controls the expression of three sRNAs in A.
      tumefaciens. Taken together, these data support a model in which VtlR indirectly 
      regulates hundreds of genes via manipulation of sRNA pathways in A. tumefaciens, 
      and moreover, while the VtlR/LsrB protein is present and structurally conserved
      in many members of the Alphaproteobacteria, the VtlR/LsrB regulatory circuitry
      has diverged in order to accommodate the unique environmental niche of each
      organism.

TI  - Strain ATCC 4720(T) is the authentic type strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens,
      which is not a later heterotypic synonym of Agrobacterium radiobacter.
PG  - 5172-5176
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.004443 [doi]
AB  - The original type strains of Agrobacterium radiobacter and Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens recorded in the eighth edition of Bergey's Manual of Determinative
      Bacteriology published in 1974 were NCIB 9042(T) and ATCC 4720(T), respectively. 
      However, in the list of the valid names of bacteria compiled in 1980, both
      strains were changed, A. radiobacter NCIB 9042(T) to ATCC 19358(T) and A.
      tumefaciens ATCC 4720(T) to ATCC 23308(T). These changes were unjustified,
      particularly in the case of A. tumefaciens whose type strain was replaced by
      another strain from the same collection, although the original type strain ATCC
      4720(T) was never lost and it is currently available in several culture
      collections. Therefore, we request that the type strain of A. tumefaciens be
      corrected from ATCC 23308(T) to ATCC 4720(T).

TI  - Metabolic Responses to Arsenite Exposure Regulated through Histidine Kinases PhoR
      and AioS in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A.
LID - E1339 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8091339 [doi]
AB  - Arsenite (As(III)) oxidation is a microbially-catalyzed transformation that
      directly impacts arsenic toxicity, bioaccumulation, and bioavailability in
      environmental systems. The genes for As(III) oxidation (aio) encode a periplasmic
      As(III) sensor AioX, transmembrane histidine kinase AioS, and cognate regulatory 
      partner AioR, which control expression of the As(III) oxidase AioBA. The aio
      genes are under ultimate control of the phosphate stress response via histidine
      kinase PhoR. To better understand the cell-wide impacts exerted by these key
      histidine kinases, we employed (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) and
      liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics to
      characterize the metabolic profiles of DeltaphoR and DeltaaioS mutants of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A during As(III) oxidation. The data reveals a smaller
      group of metabolites impacted by the DeltaaioS mutation, including hypoxanthine
      and various maltose derivatives, while a larger impact is observed for the
      DeltaphoR mutation, influencing betaine, glutamate, and different sugars. The
      metabolomics data were integrated with previously published transcriptomics
      analyses to detail pathways perturbed during As(III) oxidation and those
      modulated by PhoR and/or AioS. The results highlight considerable disruptions in 
      central carbon metabolism in the DeltaphoR mutant. These data provide a detailed 
      map of the metabolic impacts of As(III), PhoR, and/or AioS, and inform current
      paradigms concerning arsenic-microbe interactions and nutrient cycling in
      contaminated environments.

TI  - Effects of Arabidopsis Ku80 deletion on the integration of the left border of
      T-DNA into plant chromosomal DNA via Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 173-182
LID - 10.1266/ggs.19-00064 [doi]
AB  - T-DNA integration into plant chromosomal DNA via Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be
      achieved by exploiting the double-strand break repair system of the host's DNA.
      However, the detailed mechanism of T-DNA integration remains unclear. Here, a
      sequence analysis of the junction sequences of T-DNA and chromosomal DNA was
      performed to assess the mechanism of T-DNA integration. T-DNA was introduced into
      Arabidopsis wild-type and NHEJ-deficient ku80 mutant plants using the floral dip 
      method; the junctions of the left border (LB) of T-DNA were subsequently analyzed
      by adapter PCR. The most frequent junction of the LB of T-DNA with chromosomal
      DNA was of the filler DNA type in both lines. The lengths of direct or inverted
      repeat sequences within or around the filler DNA sequence were greater in the
      ku80 mutant. In addition, the frequency of T-DNA integration near a transcription
      start site was significantly higher in the ku80 mutant. Our observations suggest 
      that the presence of the Ku80 protein affects the location of the integration of 
      T-DNA and the pattern of formation of repeat sequences within or around the
      filler DNA during LB integration into chromosomal DNA.

TI  - Quantitative proteomic profiling of shake flask versus bioreactor growth reveals 
      distinct responses of Agrobacterium tumefaciens for preparation in molecular
      pharming.
PG  - 75-84

AB  - The preparation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens cultures with strains encoding
      proteins intended for therapeutic or industrial purposes is an important activity
      prior to treatment of plants for transient expression of valuable protein
      products. The rising demand for biologic products such as these underscores the
      expansion of molecular pharming and warrants the need to produce transformed
      plants at an industrial scale. This requires large quantities of A. tumefaciens
      culture, which is challenging using traditional growth methods (e.g., shake
      flask). To overcome this limitation, we investigate the use of bioreactors as an 
      alternative to shake flasks to meet production demands. Here, we observe
      differences in bacterial growth among the tested parameters and define conditions
      for consistent bacterial culturing between shake flask and bioreactor.
      Quantitative proteomic profiling of cultures from each growth condition defines
      unique growth-specific responses in bacterial protein abundance and highlights
      the functional roles of these proteins, which may influence bacterial processes
      important for effective agroinfiltration and transformation. Overall, our study
      establishes and optimizes comparable growth conditions for shake flask versus
      bioreactors and provides novel insights into fundamental biological processes of 
      A. tumefaciens influenced by such growth conditions.

AB  - Root exudates play a critical role in root-microbe interactions. Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens causes crown gall disease in multiple plant species, but rose root
      exudate-mediated inhibition of Agrobacterium in the rhizosphere is poorly
      understood. In this study, the influence of preinoculation with beneficial
      bacteria or pathogens on root exudates and subsequent colonization by A.
      tumefaciens was investigated in a split-root system. We found that preinoculation
      of rose plants in a split-root system with Bacillus velezensis CLA178 or A.
      tumefaciens C58 inhibited subsequent colonization by C58. Root secretion of
      valine had positive effects on the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, colonization of
      C58, and crown gall disease severity, but valine secretion decreased
      significantly when Rosa multiflora plants were preinoculated with CLA178 or C58. 
      These results indicated that rose plants reduced root secretion of valine in
      response to microbial colonization, thereby reducing the colonization of
      Agrobacterium colonization and disease severity. This study provides new insights
      into the root exudate-mediated interactions of rose plants, B. velezensis, and A.
      tumefaciens and proposes a potential way to control crown gall disease.

AB  - Due to minute size and limited sequence complexity, small proteins can be
      challenging to identify but are emerging as important regulators of diverse
      processes in bacteria. In this issue of the Journal of Bacteriology, Kraus and
      coworkers (A. Kraus, M. Weskamp, J. Zierles, M. Balzer, et al., J Bacteriol
      202:e00309-20, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00309-20) report a comprehensive 
      analysis of a fascinating subfamily of arginine-rich small proteins in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, conserved among Alphaproteobacteria Their findings
      reveal that these small proteins are under complex regulation and have a
      disproportionately large impact on metabolism and behavior.

      polysaccharide-based microbial flocculant in Agrobacterium tumefaciens F2.
PG  - 8479-8488
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10850-2 [doi]
AB  - The low yield as bottleneck problem limits the application of microbial
      flocculant in water treatment. However, genetic information of microbial
      flocculant-producing strains can guide the regulation of microbial flocculant
      production, but it remains unknown. Agrobacterium tumefaciens F2 produced
      polysaccharide-based microbial flocculants in the fermentation medium but none in
      Luria Bertani medium; hence, the transcriptome was used to analyze the
      potentially associated genes with the production of microbial flocculants.
      Glucose, mannose, rhamnose, and galactose are the main sugar monomers, and genes 
      (manA, glmM, manC, rfb genes, exo genes, etc.) with changed expression levels
      related to sugar monomers metabolism potentially participated in the biosynthesis
      of polysaccharide-based microbial flocculants. exoC, exoP, and manC were
      confirmed to participate in the biosynthesis via constructing the mutants
      F2-dexoC, F2-dexoP, and F2-dmanC. An exoF2 gene cluster was annotated due to the 
      high percentage of matches between the genome sequences of strains F2 and C58,
      and exo genes in their genome sequences showed the similarity of 86~92%. The
      hypothetical pathway for the biosynthesis of polysaccharide-based microbial
      flocculants in strain F2 was proposed, laying the basis for the production yield 
      regulation. KEY POINTS: * An exoF2 gene cluster in the polysaccharide
      biosynthesis was annotated. * exoC, exoP, and manC genes participated in the
      polysaccharide biosynthesis. * A hypothetical biosynthesis pathway of
      polysaccharide in flocculant was proposed. Graphical abstract.

TI  - Exposure of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to agroinfiltration medium demonstrates
      cellular remodelling and may promote enhanced adaptability for molecular
      pharming.
PG  - 85-97
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2020-0239 [doi]
AB  - Agroinfiltration is used to treat plants with modified strains of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens for the purpose of transient in planta expression of genes
      transferred from the bacterium. These genes encode valuable recombinant proteins 
      for therapeutic or industrial applications. Treatment of large quantities of
      plants for industrial-scale protein production exposes bacteria (harboring genes 
      of interest) to agroinfiltration medium that is devoid of nutrients and carbon
      sources for prolonged periods of time (possibly upwards of 24 h). Such conditions
      may negatively influence bacterial viability, infectivity of plant cells, and
      target protein production. Here, we explored the role of timing in bacterial
      culture preparation for agroinfiltration using mass spectrometry-based proteomics
      to define changes in cellular processes. We observed distinct profiles associated
      with bacterial treatment conditions and exposure timing, including significant
      changes in proteins involved in pathogenesis, motility, and nutrient acquisition 
      systems as the bacteria adapt to the new environment. These data suggest a
      progression towards increased cellular remodelling over time. In addition, we
      described changes in growth- and environment-specific processes over time,
      underscoring the interconnectivity of pathogenesis and chemotaxis-associated
      proteins with transport and metabolism. Overall, our results have important
      implications for the production of transiently expressed target protein products,
      as prolonged exposure to agroinfiltration medium suggests remodelling of the
      bacterial proteins towards enhanced infection of plant cells.

      Inducible Bacterial Toxin-Antitoxin System.

AB  - High-value pharmaceutical products are already successfully produced in contained
      facilities using Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation of plants.
      However, transfection methods suitable for open field applications are still
      desirable as a cheaper alternative. Biosafety concerns related to the use of
      recombinant agrobacteria in an industrial transfection process include possible
      transformation or transfection of unintended hosts or spread of the genetically
      modified agrobacteria in the environment. In this paper, we explored a novel
      biocontrol approach resulting in greater biosafety of the transient expression
      process in plants. Our proposed solution involves inducible expression of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens toxin PemK and antitoxin PemI that provides for
      strictly regulated T-DNA transfer from agrobacteria to plants. We also identified
      several other toxins from putative Agrobacterium toxin-antitoxin modules and
      demonstrate their potential usefulness in the control of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens as a DNA vector.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens ferritins play an important role in full virulence
      through regulating iron homeostasis and oxidative stress survival.
PG  - 1167-1178
LID - 10.1111/mpp.12969 [doi]
AB  - Ferritins are a large family of iron storage proteins, which are used by bacteria
      and other organisms to avoid iron toxicity and as a safe iron source in the
      cytosol. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a phytopathogen, has two ferritin-encoding
      genes: atu2771 and atu2477. Atu2771 is annotated as a Bfr-encoding gene
      (Bacterioferritin, Bfr) and atu2477 as a Dps-encoding gene (DNA binding protein
      from starved cells, Dps). Three deletion mutants (Deltabfr, Deltadps, and bfr-dps
      double-deletion mutant DeltabdF) of these two ferritin-encoding genes were
      constructed to investigate the effects of ferritin deficiency on the iron
      homeostasis, oxidative stress resistance, and pathogenicity of A. tumefaciens.
      Deficiency of two ferritins affects the growth of A. tumefaciens under iron
      starvation and excess. When supplied with moderate iron, the growth of A.
      tumefaciens is not affected by the deficiency of ferritin. Deficiency of ferritin
      significantly reduces iron accumulation in the cells of A. tumefaciens, but the
      effect of Bfr deficiency on iron accumulation is severer than Dps deficiency and 
      the double mutant DeltabdF has the least intracellular iron content. All three
      ferritin-deficient mutants showed a decreased tolerance to 3 mM H2 O2 in
      comparison with the wild type. The tumour induced by each of three
      ferritin-deficient mutants is less than that of the wild type. Complementation
      reversed the effects of ferritin deficiency on the growth, iron homeostasis,
      oxidative stress resistance, and tumorigenicity of A. tumefaciens. Therefore,
      ferritin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of A. tumefaciens through
      regulating iron homeostasis and oxidative stress survival.

TI  - Solving the Puzzle: Connecting a Heterologous Agrobacterium tumefaciens T6SS
      Effector to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa Spike Complex.
PG  - 291
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2020.00291 [doi]
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile injection apparatus that
      translocates a spike loaded with various effectors directly into eukaryotic and
      prokaryotic target cells. Such T6SS spike consists of a needle-shaped trimer of
      VgrG proteins topped by a conical and sharp PAAR protein that facilitates
      puncturing of the target membrane. T6SS-delivered effector proteins can be either
      fused to one of the two spike proteins or interact with either in a highly
      specific manner. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens the T6SS effector Tde1 is targeted 
      to its cognate VgrG1 protein. Here, we attempted to use a VgrG shuttle to deliver
      a heterologous T6SS effector by directing Tde1 onto a T6SS spike in Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. For this, we designed chimeras between VgrG1 from A. tumefaciens and 
      VgrG1a from P. aeruginosa and showed that modification of the spike protein
      hampered T6SS functionality in the presence of the Tde1 effector complex. We
      provide evidence suggesting that Tde1 specifically binds to the VgrG spike in the
      heterologous environment and propose that there are additional requirements to
      allow proper effector delivery and translocation. Our work sheds light on complex
      aspects of the molecular mechanisms of T6SS delivery and highlights some
      limitations on how effectors can be translocated using this nanomachine.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens Small Lipoprotein Atu8019 Is Involved in Selective
      Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) Docking to Bacterial Cells.
PG  - 1228
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01228 [doi]
AB  - Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), released from Gram-negative bacteria, have been
      attributed to intra- and interspecies communication and pathogenicity in diverse 
      bacteria. OMVs carry various components including genetic material, toxins,
      signaling molecules, or proteins. Although the molecular mechanism(s) of cargo
      delivery is not fully understood, recent studies showed that transfer of the OMV 
      content to surrounding cells is mediated by selective interactions. Here, we show
      that the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of crown
      gall disease, releases OMVs, which attach to the cell surface of various
      Gram-negative bacteria. The OMVs contain the conserved small lipoprotein Atu8019.
      An atu8019-deletion mutant produced wildtype-like amounts of OMVs with a subtle
      but reproducible reduction in cell-attachment. Otherwise, loss of atu8019 did not
      alter growth, susceptibility against cations or antibiotics, attachment to plant 
      cells, virulence, motility, or biofilm formation. In contrast, overproduction of 
      Atu8019 in A. tumefaciens triggered cell aggregation and biofilm formation.
      Localization studies revealed that Atu8019 is surface exposed in Agrobacterium
      cells and in OMVs supporting a role in cell adhesion. Purified Atu8019 protein
      reconstituted into liposomes interacted with model membranes and with the surface
      of several Gram-negative bacteria. Collectively, our data suggest that the small 
      lipoprotein Atu8019 is involved in OMV docking to specific bacteria.

TI  - Enzymatic and Mutational Analysis of the PruA Pteridine Reductase Required for
      Pterin-Dependent Control of Biofilm Formation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - JB.00098-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00098-20 [doi]
AB  - Pterins are ubiquitous biomolecules with diverse functions including roles as
      cofactors, pigments, and redox mediators. Recently, a novel pterin-dependent
      signaling pathway that controls biofilm formation was identified in the plant
      pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens A key player in this pathway is a pteridine
      reductase termed PruA, where its enzymatic activity has been shown to control
      surface attachment and limit biofilm formation. Here, we biochemically
      characterize PruA to investigate the catalytic properties and substrate
      specificity of this pteridine reductase. PruA demonstrates maximal catalytic
      efficiency with dihydrobiopterin and comparable activities with the stereoisomers
      dihydromonapterin and dihydroneopterin. Since A. tumefaciens does not synthesize 
      or utilize biopterins, the likely physiological substrate is dihydromonapterin or
      dihydroneopterin, or both. Notably, PruA does not exhibit pteridine reductase
      activity with dihydrofolate or fully oxidized pterins. Site-directed mutagenesis 
      studies of a conserved tyrosine residue, the key component of a putative
      catalytic triad, indicate that this tyrosine is not directly involved in PruA
      catalysis but may be important for substrate or cofactor binding. Additionally,
      mutagenesis of the arginine residue in the N-terminal TGX3RXG motif significantly
      reduces the catalytic efficiency of PruA, supporting its proposed role in pterin 
      binding and catalysis. Finally, we report the enzymatic characterization of PruA 
      homologs from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Brucella abortus, thus expanding the
      roles and potential significance of pteridine reductases in diverse
      bacteria.Importance Biofilms are complex multicellular communities that are
      formed by diverse bacteria. In the plant pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the
      transition from a free-living motile state to a non-motile biofilm state is
      governed by a novel signaling pathway involving small molecules called pterins.
      The involvement of pterins in biofilm formation is unexpected and prompts many
      questions about the molecular details of this pathway. This work biochemically
      characterizes the PruA pteridine reductase involved in the signaling pathway to
      reveal its enzymatic properties and substrate preference, thus providing
      important insight into pterin biosynthesis and its role in A. tumefaciens biofilm
      control. Additionally, the enzymatic characteristics of related pteridine
      reductases from mammalian pathogens are examined to uncover potential roles of
      these enzymes in other bacteria.

AB  - The persistence of pathogenic Agrobacterium strains as soil-associated
      saprophytes may cause an inconsistency in the efficacy of the biocontrol
      inoculants under field condition. The study of the interaction occurring in the
      rhizosphere between the beneficial and the pathogenic microbes is thus
      interesting for the development of effective biopesticides for the management of 
      crown gall disease. However, very little is still known about the influence of
      these complex interactions on the biocontrol determinants of beneficial bacteria,
      especially Bacillus strains. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the soil 
      borne pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 on root colonization and lipopeptide
      production by Bacillus velezensis strain 32a during interaction with tomato
      plants. Results show that the presence of A. tumefaciens C58 positively impacted 
      the root colonization level of the Bacillus strain. However, negative impact on
      surfactin production was observed in Agrobacterium-treated seedling, compared
      with control. Further investigation suggests that these modulations are due to a 
      modified tomato root exudate composition during the tripartite interaction. Thus,
      this work contributes to enhance the knowledge on the impact of interspecies
      interaction on the ecological fitness of Bacillus cells living in the
      rhizosphere.

AB  - The fumigant antibacterial activities of 50 plant essential oils belonging to 10 
      families were investigated against Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Among the test
      plant essential oils, Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon bark) essential oil showed the
      most potent fumigant antibacterial activity. When we investigated the
      antibacterial activities of compounds identified from cinnamon bark essential oil
      and 9 congeners of trans-cinnamaldehyde, lengths of inhibition zone of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde, salicylaldehyde and hydrocinnamaldehyde were 1.28, 1.73,
      and 1.24 cm at 0.625 mg/paper disc concentration, respectively. To determine the 
      mode of action of trans-cinnamaldehyde and salicylaldehyde, intercellular
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell membrane integrity were
      determined using a confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, we compared
      the up- and down-regulated gene expression of A. tumefaciens treated with
      trans-cinnamaldehyde and salicylaldehyde with that of untreated A. tumefaciens.
      With cutoffs of |log2FC| > 1 and FDR < 0.05, 29 and 43 down-regulated genes and
      27 and 117 up-regulated genes were found in the treatment of trans-cinnamaldehyde
      and salicylaldehyde, respectively. Based on the ROS generation results, cell
      membrane integrity assay, and gene expression, we conclude that the antibacterial
      mode of action of trans-cinnamaldehyde and salicylaldehyde is ROS generation by
      the Fenton reaction caused by the down-regulation of an ATP synthesis-related
      gene cluster, corrupted iron ion homeostasis, and a corrupted ROS defense
      mechanism. The high concentration of ROS damaged the A. tumefaciens cell
      membrane, which caused cell death.

AB  - Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is an important vegetable crop in the world.
      Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic technology is an important way to study plant
      gene functions and improve varieties. In order to further accelerate the
      transgenic research and breeding process of cucumber, we described the progress
      and problems of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transgenic cucumber, from the 
      influencing factors of cucumber regeneration ability, genetic transformation
      conditions and various additives in the process. We prospected for improving the 
      genetic transformation efficiency and safety selection markers of cucumber, and
      hoped to provide reference for the research of cucumber resistance breeding and
      quality improvement.

      plant Utricularia gibba.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s13007-020-00592-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Utricularia belongs to Lentibulariaceae, the largest family
      of carnivorous plants, which includes terrestrial, epiphytic and aquatic species.
      The development of specialized structures that evolved for carnivory is a feature
      of this genus that has been of great interest to biologists since Darwin's early 
      studies. Utricularia gibba is itself an aquatic plant with sophisticated bladder 
      traps having one of the most complex suction mechanisms for trapping prey.
      However, the molecular characterization of the mechanisms that regulate trap
      development and the biophysical processes involved in prey trapping are still
      largely unknown due to the lack of a simple and reproducible gene transfer
      system. RESULTS: Here, we report the establishment of a simple, fast and
      reproducible protocol for genetic transformation of U. gibba based on the T-DNA
      of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. An in vitro selection system using Phosphinotricin 
      as a selective agent was established for U. gibba. Plant transformation was
      confirmed by histochemical GUS assays and PCR and qRT-PCR analyses. We report on 
      the expression pattern of the 35S promoter and of the promoter of a trap-specific
      ribonuclease gene in transgenic U. gibba plants. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic
      transformation protocol reported here is an effective method for studying
      developmental biology and functional genomics of this genus of carnivorous plants
      and advances the utility of U. gibba as a model system to study developmental
      processes involved in trap formation.

      Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells.

AB  - Acylase is known as a quorum quenching enzyme that degrades N-acyl-homoserine
      lactones (AHLs), a key signaling molecule in a quorum sensing (QS) mechanism.
      Acylase I cleaves the acyl-chain in the chemical structures of AHLs, thereby
      exerting an anti-biofilm effect by the inhibition of bacterial cell-cell
      communication and resultant secretion of extracellular polymeric substances
      (EPS). However, the physical and physiological impacts of acylase on bacterial
      cells remain to be systematically elucidated. This study, therefore, investigated
      the effect of active and inactive acylase addition on the growth, viability, and 
      cell morphologies of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. For comparison, active and
      inactive lysozymes were taken as positive controls. The results showed that
      active acylase inhibited A. tumefaciens cell growth at concentrations ranging
      from 0.1 to 1000 mug mL(-1), and so did active lysozyme. Fluorescent detection by
      Live/Dead staining underpinned that cell viability of A. tumefaciens decreased at
      concentrations higher than 0.1 mug mL(-1) for both acylase and lysozyme, although
      lysozyme inflicted higher degree of cellular damage. Moreover, atomic force
      microscopy unraveled a noticeable distortion of A. tumefaciens cells by both
      acylase and lysozyme. Together, the results showed that acylase not only blocked 
      AHLs-based QS mechanisms but also compromised cell viability and altered surface 
      morphology of A. tumefaciens cells, as observed by the addition of hydrolase.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Three Milkweed Species
      (Asclepias hallii, A. syriaca, and A. tuberosa: Apocynaceae).
PG  - e20105
LID - 10.1002/cppb.20105 [doi]
AB  - Milkweeds have ecological significance for insect herbivores that rely on them as
      hosts for either part of or the entirety of their life cycles. Interesting
      interactions, some of which are not completely understood, have evolved over
      time. To develop these species as models to elucidate the interplay with insect
      herbivores, we established Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      approaches for Asclepias hallii (Hall's milkweed), A. syriaca (common milkweed), 
      and A. tuberosa (butterflyweed). The method is based on infection of stem
      internodal explants, which were more amenable to transformation than leaf
      explants. We found that addition of freshly prepared dithiothreitol was critical 
      to prevent browning of stem explants. Depending on the species, the time from
      infection to the regeneration of transgenic lines ranges from 2 to 4 months.
      Transformation efficiency for A. hallii was 9%, whereas efficiencies for A.
      syriaca and A. tuberosa were 6% and 13%, respectively. (c) 2020 by John Wiley &

TI  - Induction of competent cells for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated stable
      transformation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).
PG  - e0229909
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0229909 [doi]
AB  - Stable transformation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) has been successful,
      to date, only using biolistic-mediated transformation and shoot regeneration from
      meristem-containing embryo axes. In this study, using precultured embryo axes,
      and optimal co-cultivation conditions resulted in a successful transformation of 
      the common bean cultivar Olathe using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105.
      Plant regeneration through somatic embryogenesis was attained through the
      preculture of embryo axes for 12 weeks using induced competent cells for A.
      tumefaciens-mediated gene delivery. Using A. tumefaciens at a low optical density
      (OD) of 0.1 at a wavelength of 600 nm for infection and 4-day co-cultivation,
      compared to OD600 of 0.5, increased the survival rate of the inoculated explants 
      from 23% to 45%. Selection using 0.5 mg L-1 glufosinate (GS) was effective to
      identify transformed cells when the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene under the
      constitutive 35S promoter was used as a selectable marker. After an 18-week
      selection period, 1.5% -2.5% inoculated explants, in three experiments with a
      total of 600 explants, produced GS-resistant plants through somatic
      embryogenesis. The expression of bar was confirmed in first- and
      second-generation seedlings of the two lines through reverse polymerase chain
      reaction. Presence of the bar gene was verified through genome sequencing of two 
      selected transgenic lines. The induction of regenerable, competent cells is key
      for the successful transformation, and the protocols described may be useful for 
      future transformation of additional Phaseolus germplasm.

TI  - Functional analysis of the agnH gene involved in nicotine-degradation pathways in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain SCUEC1.
LID - fnaa040 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnaa040 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain SCUEC1 is a nicotine-degrading bacterium, which 
      has been recently isolated from the tobacco waste-contaminated field soil.
      However, the mechanism for nicotine degradation in this strain remains unclear.
      Here, we analyze the function and biological properties of the agnH gene in the
      strain SCUEC1. The overexpression of the AgnH protein was detected by SDS-PAGE
      analysis, and functional insight of the AgnH protein was carried out with
      monitoring the changes of maleic acid into fumaric acid by high performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC). Moreover, the effects of temperature, pH and metal 
      ions on the enzymatic activities of the AgnH protein were also analyzed. The
      results demonstrated that the agnH gene was successfully ligated to the plasmid
      pET28a. The optimal condition for the enzymatic activities for the AgnH,
      approximately 28.0 kDa, was determined as 37 degrees C, pH 8.0 and 25 microM
      Mg2+. Conclusively, the agnH gene fulfils an important role in the conversion of 
      maleic acid into fumaric acid involved in nicotine-degradation pathways in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain SCUEC1.

TI  - A High-Throughput Interbacterial Competition Screen Identifies ClpAP in Enhancing
      Recipient Susceptibility to Type VI Secretion System-Mediated Attack by
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 3077
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.03077 [doi]
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is an effector delivery system used by
      Gram-negative bacteria to kill other bacteria or eukaryotic hosts to gain
      fitness. The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens utilizes its T6SS to kill
      other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. We observed that the A. tumefaciens
      T6SS-dependent killing outcome differs when using different T6SS-lacking, K-12 E.
      coli strains as a recipient cell. Thus, we hypothesized that the A. tumefaciens
      T6SS killing outcome not only relies on the T6SS activity of the attacker cells
      but also depends on the recipient cells. Here, we developed a high-throughput
      interbacterial competition platform to test the hypothesis by screening for
      mutants with reduced killing outcomes caused by A. tumefaciens strain C58. Among 
      the 3,909 strains in the E. coli Keio library screened, 16 mutants with less
      susceptibility to A. tumefaciens C58 T6SS-dependent killing were identified, and 
      four of them were validated by complementation test. Among the four, the clpP
      encoding ClpP protease, which is universal and highly conserved in both
      prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles, was selected for further
      characterizations. We demonstrated that ClpP is responsible for enhancing
      susceptibility to the T6SS killing. Because ClpP protease depends on other
      adapter proteins such as ClpA and ClpX for substrate recognition, further mutant 
      studies followed by complementation tests were carried out to reveal that
      ClpP-associated AAA(+) ATPase ClpA, but not ClpX, is involved in enhancing
      susceptibility to A. tumefaciens T6SS killing. Moreover, functional and
      biochemical studies of various ClpP amino acid substitution variants provided
      evidence that ClpA-ClpP interaction is critical in enhancing susceptibility to
      the T6SS killing. This study highlights the importance of recipient factors in
      determining the outcome of the T6SS killing and shows the universal ClpP protease
      as a novel recipient factor hijacked by the T6SS of A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Effects of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain types on the Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation efficiency of filamentous fungus Mortierella alpina.
PG  - 388-393
LID - 10.1111/lam.13286 [doi]
AB  - Four Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains AGL-1, C58C1, EHA105 and LBA4404 were
      tested for the effects of strain types on the transformation efficiency in
      Mortierella alpina. Results showed that AGL-1, C58C1 and EHA105 transformed M.
      alpina successfully. Among them, A. tumefaciens EHA105 was first proven
      successful transformation of M. alpina. AGL-1 and EHA105 had the highest
      transformation efficiency among the four strains, while LBA4404 failed to
      transform M. alpina. The reason leading to the transformation efficiency
      difference among the four strains was explored by determining transcription
      levels of the virulence (vir) gene in the induction medium. Results showed that
      the expressions of virD1, virD2, virD4 and virE1 genes were obviously induced by 
      acetosyringone in all the strains, and their transcriptional levels as well as
      virA's of AGL-1, C58C1 and EHA105 were higher than that of LBA4404, suggesting
      high transcriptional levels of vir genes were important for successful
      transformation. The study selected A. tumefaciens with high transformation
      efficiency of M. alpina, and would accelerate the genetic management of M.
      alpina. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Oleaginous filamentous fungus
      Mortierella alpina is a commercial strain for the production of arachidonic acid.
      Genetic manipulation of M. alpina requires highly efficient transformation
      method. In this study, we explore the effect of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain 
      types on the transformation efficiency of M. alpina and select A. tumefaciens
      with the highest transformation efficiency, which accelerates the genetic
      manipulation of M. alpina. Besides, high transcriptional levels of virulence
      genes in A. tumefaciens were proven to play an important role for successful
      transformation.

TI  - Acidocalcisomes and Polyphosphate Granules Are Different Subcellular Structures
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e02759-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02759-19 [doi]
AB  - Acidocalcisomes are membrane-enclosed, polyphosphate-containing acidic organelles
      in lower Eukaryota but have also been described for Agrobacterium tumefaciens (M.
      Seufferheld, M. Vieira, A. Ruiz, C. O. Rodrigues, S. Moreno, and R. Docampo, J
      Biol Chem 278:29971-29978, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M304548200). This
      study aimed at the characterization of polyphosphate-containing acidocalcisomes
      in this alphaproteobacterium. Unexpectedly, fluorescence microscopic
      investigation of A. tumefaciens cells using fluorescent dyes and localization of 
      constructed fusions of polyphosphate kinases (PPKs) and of vacuolar
      H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (HppA) with enhanced yellow fluorescent
      protein (eYFP) suggested that acidocalcisomes and polyphosphate are different
      subcellular structures. Acidocalcisomes and polyphosphate granules were
      frequently located close together, near the cell poles. However, they never
      shared the same position. Mutant strains of A. tumefaciens with deletions of both
      ppk genes (Deltappk1 Deltappk2) were unable to form polyphosphate but still
      showed cell pole-located eYFP-HppA foci and could be stained with MitoTracker. In
      conclusion, A. tumefaciens forms polyP granules that are free of a surrounding
      membrane and thus resemble polyP granules of Ralstonia eutropha and other
      bacteria. The composition, contents, and function of the subcellular structures
      that are stainable with MitoTracker and harbor eYFP-HppA remain
      unclear.IMPORTANCE The uptake of alphaproteobacterium-like cells by ancestors of 
      eukaryotic cells and subsequent conversion of these alphaproteobacterium-like
      cells to mitochondria are thought to be key steps in the evolution of the first
      eukaryotic cells. The identification of acidocalcisomes in two
      alphaproteobacterial species some years ago and the presence of homologs of the
      vacuolar proton-translocating pyrophosphatase HppA, a marker protein of the
      acidocalcisome membrane in eukaryotes, in virtually all species within the
      alphaproteobacteria suggest that eukaryotic acidocalcisomes might also originate 
      from related structures in ancestors of alphaproteobacterial species.
      Accordingly, alphaproteobacterial acidocalcisomes and eukaryotic acidocalcisomes 
      should have similar features. Since hardly any information is available on
      bacterial acidocalcisomes, this study aimed at the characterization of
      organelle-like structures in alphaproteobacterial cells, with A. tumefaciens as
      an example.

TI  - Identification of the genes involved in growth characters of medicinal fungus
      Ophiocordyceps sinensis based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation.
PG  - 2663-2674
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10417-1 [doi]
AB  - Ophiocordyceps sinensis, one of the well-known and precious fungal species in the
      world, parasitizes soil-dwelling larvae of ghost moths on the Tibetan Plateau.
      The genetic intractability of this extremely psychrophilic and slow-growing O.
      sinensis fungus is a major limitation on the molecular study. In this study, an
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation (ATMT) system for this 
      fungus was established. ATMT procedure was optimized based on the fungal
      recipient, Agrobacterium strains, and different co-cultivation conditions.
      Blastospores were ideal recipients for this system. Acetosyringone (AS) was not
      essential for the transformation of O. sinensis. Sixty to 100 hygromycin
      B-resistant transformants per 1 x 10(6) blastospores were obtained. Southern blot
      analysis indicated the presence of a random single-copy integration of T-DNA into
      the O. sinensis genome. The insertional transformants with altered growth
      characters such as colony, blastospore, and fruiting body production were
      selected to identify the T-DNA flanking sequences by modified hiTAIL-PCR and
      FPNI-PCR techniques. Eight genes, including genes for an MFS transporter, a
      2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, a DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex subunit
      Rpc37, a cytochrome oxidase subunit I, a mitochondrial import inner membrane
      translocase subunit tim54, a cytidine deaminase, a phosphoribosylaminoimidazole
      carboxylase, and a histone H3-like centromeric protein cse-4 were identified.
      This ATMT system provides a useful tool for gene discovery and characterization
      of O. sinensis and contributes to the better understanding of the mysterious life
      cycle of O. sinensis and the molecular interaction between this fungus and its
      host insects.

TI  - Analysis of carotenoid profile changes and carotenogenic genes transcript levels 
      in Rhodosporidium toruloides mutants from an optimized Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation method.
PG  - 71-81
LID - 10.1002/bab.1895 [doi]
AB  - Rhodosporidium toruloides has been reported as a potential biotechnological
      microorganism to produce carotenoids. The most commonly used molecular and
      genetic manipulation methods based on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
      (ATMT). However, this method was of relatively lower transformation efficiency.
      In this study, we optimized the ATMT method for R. toruloides on account of the
      promoter on T-DNA, the ratio of A. tumefaciens to R. toruloides NP11,
      acetosyringone concentration, cocultivation temperature and time, and a
      transformation efficiency of 2,369 cells per 10(5) recipient cells was obtained
      and was 24 times as that of the previous report. With this optimized method, four
      redder mutants and four yellower mutants were selected out with torularhodin and 
      beta-carotene production preference, respectively. The highest torularhodin
      production was 1,638.15 microg/g dry cell weight in A1-13. The yellower mutants
      were found to divert the metabolic flux from torularhodin and torulene to
      gamma-carotene and beta-carotene, and the proportion of gamma-carotene and
      beta-carotene were all over 92%. TAIL-PCR was carried out to found T-DNA
      insertion in these mutants, and insertion hotspot was found. RT-qPCR results
      showed that CTA1 genes in these mutants were closely related to the synthesis of 
      total carotenoids, especially torularhodin, and was a potenial metabolic
      engineering site in the future.

TI  - The MexE/MexF/AmeC Efflux Pump of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Its Role in Ti
      Plasmid Virulence Gene Expression.
LID - e00609-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00609-19 [doi]
AB  - Expression of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid virulence genes of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens is required for the transfer of DNA from the bacterium into plant
      cells, ultimately resulting in the initiation of plant tumors. The vir genes are 
      induced as a result of exposure to certain phenol derivatives, monosaccharides,
      and low pH in the extracellular milieu. The soil, as well as wound sites on a
      plant-the usual site of the virulence activity of this bacterium-can contain
      these signals, but vir gene expression in the soil would be a wasteful
      utilization of energy. This suggests that mechanisms may exist to ensure that vir
      gene expression occurs only at the higher concentrations of inducers typically
      found at a plant wound site. In a search for transposon-mediated mutations that
      affect sensitivity for the virulence gene-inducing activity of the phenol,
      3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyacetophenone (acetosyringone [AS]), an RND-type efflux
      pump homologous to the MexE/MexF/OprN pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
      identified. Phenotypes of mutants carrying an insertion or deletion of pump
      components included hypersensitivity to the vir-inducing effects of AS,
      hypervirulence in the tobacco leaf explant virulence assay, and hypersensitivity 
      to the toxic effects of chloramphenicol. Furthermore, the methoxy substituents on
      the phenol ring of AS appear to be critical for recognition as a pump substrate. 
      These results support the hypothesis that the regulation of virulence gene
      expression is integrated with cellular activities that elevate the level of
      plant-derived inducers required for induction so that this occurs preferentially,
      if not exclusively, in a plant environment.IMPORTANCE Expression of genes
      controlling the virulence activities of a bacterial pathogen is expected to occur
      preferentially at host sites vulnerable to that pathogen. Host-derived molecules 
      that induce such activities in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens are
      found in the soil, as well as in the plant. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
      mechanisms exist to suppress the sensitivity of Agrobacterium species to a
      virulence gene-inducing molecule by selecting for mutant bacteria that are
      hypersensitive to its inducing activity. The mutant genes identified encode an
      efflux pump whose proposed activity increases the concentration of the inducer
      necessary for vir gene expression; this pump is also involved in antibiotic
      resistance, demonstrating a relationship between cellular defense activities and 
      the control of virulence in Agrobacterium.

AB  - Bacterial ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases are allosterically regulated by
      metabolites that are key intermediates of central pathways in the respective
      microorganism. Pyruvate (Pyr) and fructose 6-phosphate (Fru6P) activate the
      enzyme from Agrobacterium tumefaciens by increasing Vmax about 10- and 20-fold,
      respectively. Here, we studied the combined effect of both metabolites on the
      enzyme activation. Our results support a model in which there is a synergistic
      binding of these two activators to two distinct sites and that each activator
      leads the enzyme to distinct active forms with different properties. In presence 
      of both activators, Pyr had a catalytically dominant effect over Fru6P
      determining the active conformational state. By mutagenesis we obtained enzyme
      variants still sensitive to Pyr activation, but in which the allosteric signal by
      Fru6P was disrupted. This indicated that the activation mechanism for each
      effector was not the same. The ability for this enzyme to have more than one
      allosteric activator site, active forms, and allosteric signaling mechanisms is
      critical to expand the evolvability of its regulation. These synergistic
      interactions between allosteric activators may represent a feature in other
      allosteric enzymes.

TI  - Redundancy and Specificity of Type VI Secretion vgrG Loci in Antibacterial
      Activity of Agrobacterium tumefaciens 1D1609 Strain.
PG  - 3004
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.03004 [doi]
AB  - Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile nanoweapon employed by many
      Proteobacteria to deliver effectors to kill or inhibit their competitors. One
      T6SS gene, vgrG, encodes a spike protein for effector translocation and is often 
      present as multiple copies in bacterial genomes. Our phylogenomic analyses
      sampled 48 genomes across diverse Proteobacteria lineages and found approximately
      70% of them encode multiple VgrGs, yet only four genomes have nearly identical
      paralogs. Among these four, Agrobacterium tumefaciens 1D1609 has the highest vgrG
      redundancy. Compared to A. tumefaciens model strain C58 which harbors two vgrG
      genes, 1D1609 encodes four vgrG genes (i.e., vgrGa-d) with each adjacent to
      different putative effector genes. Thus, 1D1609 was selected to investigate the
      functional redundancy and specificity of multiple vgrG genes and their associated
      effectors. Secretion assay of single and multiple vgrG deletion mutants
      demonstrated that these four vgrGs are functionally redundant in mediating T6SS
      secretion. By analyzing various vgrG mutants, we found that all except for the
      divergent vgrGb could contribute to 1D1609's antibacterial activity. Further
      characterizations of putative effector-immunity gene pairs revealed that
      vgrGa-associated gene 2 (v2a) encodes an AHH family nuclease and serves as the
      major antibacterial toxin. Interestingly, C58's VgrG2 shares 99% amino acid
      sequence identity with 1D1609's VgrGa, VgrGc and VgrGd. This high sequence
      similarity allows 1D1609 to use an exogenous VgrG delivered from C58 to kill
      another competing bacterium. Taken together, Agrobacterium can use highly similar
      VgrGs, either produced endogenously or injected from its close relatives, for
      T6SS-mediated interbacterial competition.

      to crown gall disease.
PG  - 22-27

AB  - Bacterial flagella are perceived by the innate immune systems of plants(1) and
      animals(2) alike, triggering resistance. Common to higher plants is the
      immunoreceptor FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2)(3), which detects flagellin via its
      most conserved epitope, flg22. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes crown gall
      disease in many crop plants, has a highly diverged flg22 epitope and evades
      immunodetection by plants so far studied. We asked whether, as a next step in
      this game of 'hide and seek', there are plant species that have evolved
      immunoreceptors with specificity for the camouflaged flg22(Atum) of A.
      tumefaciens. In the wild grape species Vitis riparia, we discovered FLS2(XL), a
      previously unknown form of FLS2, that provides exquisite sensitivity to typical
      flg22 and to flg22(Atum). As exemplified by ectopic expression in tobacco,
      FLS2(XL) can limit crown gall disease caused by A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Identification of Zur boxes and determination of their roles in the differential 
      regulation of the Zur regulon in Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
PG  - 2109-2123
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10346-z [doi]
AB  - Zinc uptake regulator (Zur) is a transcriptional regulator that represses zinc
      acquisition genes under high zinc conditions. The aim of this study was to
      identify and investigate the role of Zur-binding motifs (Zur boxes) in the
      differential regulation of Zur target genes, including the zinT, znuA, znuCB-zur 
      operon, the troCBA operon, and yciC, in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. DNase I
      footprinting and gel shift assays were performed, confirming that Zur directly
      binds to 18-bp inverted repeat motifs found in the promoter of these
      Zur-regulated genes. Furthermore, promoter-lacZ fusions and mutagenesis of the
      identified Zur boxes were performed to assess the role of each Zur box. A Zur box
      found in the zinT promoter was required for zinc-dependent repression by Zur. The
      intergenic region between the znuA gene and the znuCB-zur operon contains two Zur
      boxes, named A and C, which immediately precede the genes znuA and znuC,
      respectively. Zur box A, but not Zur box C, was essential for the repression of
      the znuA promoter. Both Zur boxes A and C were implicated in the repression of
      the znuC promoter, in which mutation of either box alone was sufficient for full 
      derepression of the znuC promoter. Three Zur boxes named T, M, and Y were
      identified in the intergenic region between the troCBA operon and the yciC gene. 
      Zur box Y, which immediately precedes yciC, was shown to be responsible for Zur
      repression of the yciC promoter. In contrast, two Zur boxes, T and M, were
      essential for the complete repression of the troCBA operon, and full derepression
      of the troC promoter was exhibited when both Zur boxes were mutated
      simultaneously. Sequence analysis of the identified Zur boxes revealed a
      correlation between deviation from the core recognition sequence of the Zur box
      and the requirement of two Zur boxes for Zur regulation of distinctive promoters.

AB  - Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic cutaneous or subcutaneous mycosis that is 
      prevalent worldwide. Though CBM tends not to be fatal, it is difficult to treat
      and complications can include chronic, marked lesions, lymphatic damage, and
      neoplastic transformation. Fonsecaea monophora, as a new species segregated from 
      Fonsecaea pedrosoi, is the predominant causative pathogen of CBM in southern
      China. However, research about F. monophora has been limited, which may be due to
      a lack of an effective genetic manipulation system for F. monophora. In this
      study, we successfully established a random insertional mutagenesis system by
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) in F. monophora for the 
      first time. In order to improve the efficiency of ATMT, various co-culture
      conditions were optimized, including: acetosyringone (AS) concentrations,
      co-culture duration, ratio of bacteria to conidia, and the A. tumefaciens
      strains. In addition, thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction
      (TAIL-PCR) was performed to identify the transferred DNA (T-DNA) flanking
      sequences of the F. monophora transformants. The valuable transformants obtained 
      in this study will be used for research in the future.

TI  - Import pathways of the mannityl-opines into the bacterial pathogen Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens: structural, affinity and in vivo approaches.
PG  - 615-628
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20190886 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens pathogens use specific compounds denoted opines as
      nutrients in their plant tumor niche. These opines are produced by the host plant
      cells genetically modified by agrobacteria. They are imported into bacteria via
      solute-binding proteins (SBPs) in association with ATP-binding cassette
      transporters. The mannityl-opine family encompasses mannopine, mannopinic acid,
      agropine and agropinic acid. Structural and affinity data on mannopinic acid
      bound to SBPs are currently lacking while those of the three others mannityl
      opines are available. We investigated the molecular basis of two pathways for
      mannopinic acid uptake. MoaA was proposed as the specific SBP for mannopinic acid
      import in mannityl opines-assimilating agrobacteria, which was validated here
      using genetic studies and affinity measurements. We structurally characterized
      the mannopinic acid-binding mode of MoaA in two crystal forms at 2.05 and 1.57 A 
      resolution. We demonstrated that the non-specific SBP MotA, so far characterized 
      as mannopine and Amadori compound importer, was also able to transport mannopinic
      acid. The structure of MotA bound to mannopinic acid at 2.2 A resolution defines 
      a different mannopinic acid-binding signature, similar to that of mannopine.
      Combining in vitro and in vivo approaches, this work allowed us to complete the
      characterization of the mannityl-opines assimilation pathways, highlighting the
      important role of two dual imports of agropinic and mannopinic acids. Our data
      shed new light on how the mannityl-opines contribute to the establishment of the 
      ecological niche of agrobacteria from the early to the late stages of tumor
      development.

AB  - Tilletia foetida causes wheat common smut disease with severe loss of yield
      production and seed quality. In this study, a low-cost, rapid, and efficient
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system for T. foetida
      mutagenesis was constructed: Transformants were screened with hygromycin B at 100
      mug/ml, cefotaxime sodium concentrations with 200 mug/ml, Acetosyringone (AS)
      concentration at 200 mumol/l, 1 x 10(6) T. foetida hypha cells/ml, co-cultivation
      at 22 degrees C with 24 h and culture was incubated at 16 degrees C up to day 7. 
      Fourteen transformants were randomly selected and confirmed using the specific
      primers to amplify the fragment of hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. At the
      same time, PCR analysis was performed to detect Agrobacterium tumefaciens Vir
      gene to eliminate false positives. The transformants were cultivated up to 8
      generations on hygromycine B-containing complete medium (CM) and confirmed by
      PCR. The results indicated that 80% of T. foetida transformants were hygromycine 
      B resistant. In conclusion, our analyses identified an efficient T-DNA insertion 
      system for T. foetida and the results will be useful for further understanding
      the pathogenic mechanism via generation of the insertional mutants.

TI  - Identification of a Carboxy-Terminal Glutamine-Rich Domain in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens Coupling Protein VirD4 Required for Recognition of T-Strand DNA and
      Not VirE2 as a Substrate for Transfer to Plant Cells.
PG  - 166-172
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-04-19-0099-R [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers DNA and proteins to a plant cell inciting
      crown gall tumor disease on most plants. VirD4 targets the DNA and protein
      substrates to a type IV secretion (T4S) apparatus for translocation into the
      plant cell. Several bacteria with VirD4 homologs use T4S for intercellular export
      of microbial macromolecules to eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts. How the VirD4
      proteins recognize the diverse substrates is not well understood. To identify
      functional domains of A. tumefaciens pTiA6 VirD4, we introduced random 19-codon
      and targeted 10-codon insertions throughout the coding region. Analysis of 21
      mutants showed that only the carboxy-terminal end of VirD4 is tolerant of an
      insertion. Sequence comparison of VirD4 proteins of Agrobacterium spp. and their 
      close relative, Rhizobium etli, showed that these proteins contain a highly
      conserved C-terminal end, but the immediate upstream regions share no discernible
      sequence similarity. The conserved region sequence is rich in the amino acid
      glutamine (6/13 Q). Using site-specific and deletion mutagenesis, we demonstrated
      that the conserved Q-rich region is required for VirD4 function and for the
      specific recognition of VirD2-linked T-strand DNA as a substrate for
      translocation to plants. The Q-rich region is not required for the transfer of a 
      second A. tumefaciens substrate, VirE2, to plants or a promiscuous Escherichia
      coli IncQ plasmid to another A. tumefaciens strain. We identified Q-rich
      sequences at or near the C terminus of several VirD4 homologs, including the E.
      coli F plasmid TraD. In F TraD, the Q-rich sequence maps to a region required
      specifically for the conjugative transfer of the F plasmid.

TI  - Single Molecule Imaging of T-DNA Intermediates Following Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens Infection in Nicotiana benthamiana.
LID - E6209 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20246209 [doi]
AB  - Plant transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a well-studied
      phenomenon in which a bacterial DNA fragment (T-DNA), is transferred to the host 
      plant cell, as a single strand, via type IV secretion system and has the
      potential to reach the nucleus and to be integrated into its genome. While
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been widely used for
      laboratory-research and in breeding, the time-course of its journey from the
      bacterium to the nucleus, the conversion from single- to double-strand
      intermediates and several aspects of the integration in the genome remain
      obscure. In this study, we sought to follow T-DNA infection directly using
      single-molecule live imaging. To this end, we applied the LacO-LacI imaging
      system in Nicotiana benthamiana, which enabled us to identify double-stranded
      T-DNA (dsT-DNA) molecules as fluorescent foci. Using confocal microscopy, we
      detected progressive accumulation of dsT-DNA foci in the nucleus, starting 23 h
      after transfection and reaching an average of 5.4 and 8 foci per nucleus at 48
      and 72 h post-infection, respectively. A time-course diffusion analysis of the
      T-DNA foci has demonstrated their spatial confinement.

TI  - Transgenic expression of Hyp-1 gene from Hypericum perforatum L. alters
      expression of defense-related genes and modulates recalcitrance to Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1007/s00425-019-03310-3 [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: Phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1) isolated from
      Hypericum perforatum L. was characterized as a defense gene involved in H.
      perforatum recalcitrance to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      Hypericum perforatum L. is a reservoir of high-value secondary metabolites of
      increasing interest to researchers and to the pharmaceutical industry. However,
      improving their production via genetic manipulation is a challenging task, as H. 
      perforatum is recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. 
      Here, phenolic oxidative coupling protein (Hyp-1), a pathogenesis-related (PR)
      class 10 family gene, was selected from a subtractive cDNA library from A.
      tumefaciens-treated H. perforatum suspension cells. The role of Hyp-1 in defense 
      against A. tumefaciens was analyzed in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Lactuca
      sativa overexpressing Hyp-1, and in Catharanthus roseus silenced for its
      homologous Hyp-1 gene, CrIPR. Results showed that Agrobacterium-mediated
      expression efficiency greatly decreased in Hyp-1 transgenic plants. However,
      silencing of CrIPR induced CrPR-5 expression and decreased expression efficiency 
      of Agrobacterium. The expression of core genes involved in several defense
      pathways was also analyzed in Hyp-1 transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of 
      Hyp-1 led to an ample down-regulation of key genes involved in auxin signaling,
      microRNA-based gene silencing, detoxification of reactive oxygen species,
      phenylpropanoid pathway and PRs. Moreover, Hyp-1 was detected in the nucleus,
      plasma membrane and the cytoplasm of epidermal cells by confocal microscopy.
      Overall, our findings suggest Hyp-1 modulates recalcitrance to A.
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation in H. perforatum.

PG  - 313-320
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9952-1_24 [doi]
AB  - Daucus carota L. (carrot) is one of the ten most important vegetables cultivated 
      and consumed worldwide and is a main source of provitamin A. Carrot storage root 
      is rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and other nutrients but especially in
      carotenoids. It has been also used as plant model for studding embryogenesis, as 
      well as the genetic and genomic evolution of carrots and for carotenoid synthesis
      regulation, among others. Research in carrot often needs genetic transformation. 
      Here we describe a step-by-step protocol on the nuclear and stable transformation
      of carrot through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and somatic embryogenesis in vitro
      culture. Somatic embryos, induced by supplementation of Murashige-Skoog medium
      with the 2,4D hormone, develop into seedlings after 6 months approximately when
      plants are ready to be transferred to a greenhouse. The protocol has over 85% of 
      transformation efficiency.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Avirulent and Virulent Strains of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens from Rose Crown Gall in Selected Regions of South Korea.
LID - E452 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants8110452 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease in
      various hosts across kingdoms. In the present study, five regions (Wonju,
      Jincheon, Taean, Suncheon, and Kimhae) of South Korea were chosen to isolate A.
      tumefaciens strains on roses and assess their opine metabolism (agrocinopine,
      nopaline, and octopine) genes based on PCR amplification. These isolated strains 
      were confirmed as Agrobacterium using morphological, biochemical, and 16S rDNA
      analyses; and pathogenicity tests, including the growth characteristics of the
      white colony appearance on ammonium sulfate glucose minimal media, enzyme
      activities, 16S rDNA sequence alignment, and pathogenicity on tomato (Solanum
      lycopersicum). Carbon utilization, biofilm formation, tumorigenicity, and
      motility assays were performed to demarcate opine metabolism genes. Of 87
      isolates, 18 pathogenic isolates were affirmative for having opine plasmid genes.
      Most of these isolates showed the presence of an agrocinopine type of carbon
      utilization. Two isolates showed nopaline types. However, none of these isolates 
      showed octopine metabolic genes. The objectives of the present study were to
      isolate and confirm virulent strains from rose crown galls grown in the different
      regions of Korea and characterize their physiology and opine types. This is the
      first report to describe the absence of the octopine type inciting the crown gall
      disease of rose in South Korea.

      Ascochyta lentis to characterize ascochyta blight disease progression in lentil.
PG  - e0223419
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0223419 [doi]
AB  - The plant immune system is made up of a complex response network that involves
      several lines of defense to fight invading pathogens. Fungal plant pathogens on
      the other hand, have evolved a range of ways to infect their host. The
      interaction between Ascochyta lentis and two lentil genotypes was explored to
      investigate the progression of ascochyta blight (AB) in lentils. In this study,
      we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for A.
      lentis by constructing a new binary vector, pATMT-GpdGFP, for the constitutive
      expression of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Green fluorescence was used as a 
      highly efficient vital marker to study the developmental changes in A. lentis
      during AB disease progression on the susceptible and resistant lentil accessions,
      ILL6002 and ILL7537, respectively. The initial infection stages were similar in
      both the resistant and susceptible accessions where A. lentis uses infection
      structures such as germ tubes and appressoria to gain entry into the host while
      the host uses defense mechanisms to prevent pathogen entry. Penetration was
      observed at the junctions between neighbouring epidermal cells and occasionally, 
      through the stomata. The pathogen attempted to penetrate and colonize ILL7537,
      but further fungal advancement appeared to be halted, and A. lentis did not enter
      the mesophyll. Successful entry and colonization of ILL6002 coincided with
      structural changes in A. lentis and the onset of necrotic lesions 5-7 days post
      inoculation. Once inside the leaf, A. lentis continued to grow, colonizing all
      parts of the leaf followed by plant cell collapse. Pycnidia-bearing spores
      appeared 14 days post inoculation, which marks the completion of the infection
      cycle. The use of fluorescent proteins in plant pathogenic fungi together with
      confocal laser scanning microscopy, provide a valuable tool to study the
      intracellular dynamics, colonization strategy and infection mechanisms during
      plant-pathogen interaction.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of a hevein-like gene into
      asparagus leads to stem wilt resistance.

AB  - Asparagus stem wilt, is a significant and devastating disease, typically leading 
      to extensive economic losses in the asparagus industry. To obtain transgenic
      plants resistant to stem wilt, the hevein-like gene, providing broad spectrum
      bacterial resistance was inserted into the asparagus genome through Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The optimal genetic transformation system
      for asparagus was as follows: pre-culture of embryos for 2 days, inoculation
      using a bacterial titre of OD600 = 0.6, infection time 10 min and co-culturing
      for 4 days using an Acetosyringone concentration of 200 mumol/L. Highest
      transformation frequencies reached 21% and ten transgenic asparagus seedlings
      carrying the hevein-like gene were identified by polymerase chain reaction.
      Moreover, integration of the hevein-like gene in the T1 generation of transgenic 
      plants was confirmed by southern blot hybridization. Analysis showed that
      resistance to stem wilt was enhanced significantly in the transgenic plants, in
      comparison to non- transgenic plants. The results provide additional data for
      genetic improvement and are of importance for the development of new
      disease-resistant asparagus varieties.

TI  - An hydroxytyrosol enriched extract from olive mill wastewaters exerts antioxidant
      activity and antimicrobial activity on Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 2677-2684

AB  - An hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) enriched extract (HTE), obtained from olive mill
      wastewaters (OMWW) through an eco-friendly, patented process was tested on two
      olive tree pathogens, Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Pss) and
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At). Pss, in particular, is a feared treat for olive
      tree cultivation being the etiological agent of the olive knot disease
      responsible of severe production losses. Chemical characterization allowed to
      identify and quantify HTyr as the main constituent along with other low molecular
      weight phenols. HTE has proven potent antioxidant activity and significant
      antimicrobial activity against Pss and At in vitro, in both cases higher than
      hydroxytyrosol alone, suggesting an important role also of the minor phenolic
      components, which act synergistically with HTyr. Alternatives to the molecules
      currently present on the market are needed, but only the use of standardized
      extraction technologies would allow to conduct solid field studies and enable
      this circular approach to find a real application in the olive groves.

TI  - Highly Efficient and Heritable Targeted Mutagenesis in Wheat via the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated CRISPR/Cas9 System.
LID - E4257 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20174257 [doi]
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully used in hexaploid wheat. Although it
      has been reported that the induced mutations can be passed to the next
      generation, gene editing and transmission patterns in later generations still
      need to be studied. In this study, we demonstrated that the CRISPR/Cas9 system
      could achieve efficient mutagenesis in five wheat genes via
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of an sgRNA targeting the D genome, an
      sgRNA targeting both the A and B homologues and three tri-genome guides targeting
      the editing of all three homologues. High mutation rates and putative homozygous 
      or biallelic mutations were observed in the T0 plants. The targeted mutations
      could be stably inherited by the next generation, and the editing efficiency of
      each mutant line increased significantly across generations. The editing types
      and inheritance of targeted mutagenesis were similar, which were not related to
      the targeted subgenome number. The presence of Cas9/sgRNA could cause new
      mutations in subsequent generations, while mutated lines without Cas9/sgRNA could
      retain the mutation type. Additionally, off-target mutations were not found in
      sequences that were highly homologous to the selected sgRNA sequences. Overall,
      the results suggested that CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene editing via
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation plays important roles in wheat genome
      engineering.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens uronate dehydrogenase (AtuUdh) belongs to the
      short-chain dehydrogenase superfamily, specifically those acting on the CH-OH
      group of donor with NAD(+) or NADP(+) as acceptor. It is apparently required for 
      the production of D-glucaric acid. AtuUdh-catalyzed reaction is reversible with
      dual substrate-specific activity (D-galacturonic acid and D-glucuronic acid) in
      nature. In our study, 34 mutants were pre-screened from 155 mutants generated
      from AtuUdh (wild-type) and selected 10 structurally stable mutants with
      increased substrate selectivity. The specificity, efficiency, and selectivity of 
      these mutants for different substrates and cofactors were predicted from 121
      docked models using a substrate-imprinted docking approach. Q14F, S36L, and S75T 
      mutants have shown a high binding affinity to D-glucuronic acid and its substrate
      intermediates such as D-glucaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,5-lactone. These
      mutants exhibited a low binding affinity to the substrate and cofactor required
      for D-galactaric acid. D34S, N112E and S165E mutants found to show a high
      selectivity of D-galacturonic acid and its substrate intermediates for
      D-galactaric acid production. Ser75, Ser165, and Arg174 are active residues
      playing an imperative role in the substrate selectivity and also contributed in
      the conjecture the mechanism of transition state stabilization catalyzed by
      AtuUdh mutants. The present approach was used to reveal the substrate binding
      mechanism of AtuUdh mutants for a better understanding of the structural basis
      for selectivity and function.

TI  - Destabilization of the Tumor-Inducing Plasmid from an Octopine-Type Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens Lineage Drives a Large Deletion in the Co-resident At Megaplasmid.
PG  - 3489-3500
LID - 10.1534/g3.119.400554 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria with multi-replicon genome organizations, including members of the
      family Rhizobiaceae, often carry a variety of niche-associated functions on large
      plasmids. While evidence exists for cross-replicon interactions and co-evolution 
      between replicons in many of these systems, remarkable strain-to-strain variation
      is also observed for extrachromosomal elements, suggesting increased genetic
      plasticity. Here, we show that curing of the tumor-inducing virulence plasmid
      (pTi) of an octopine-type Agrobacterium tumefaciens lineage leads to a large
      deletion in the co-resident At megaplasmid (pAt). The deletion event is mediated 
      by a repetitive IS-element, IS66, and results in a variety of
      environment-dependent fitness consequences, including loss of independent
      conjugal transfer of the plasmid. Interestingly, a related and otherwise
      wild-type A. tumefaciens strain is missing exactly the same large pAt segment as 
      the pAt deletion derivatives, suggesting a similar event over its natural
      history. Overall, the findings presented here uncover a novel genetic interaction
      between the two large plasmids of A. tumefaciens and provide evidence for
      cross-replicon integration and co-evolution of these plasmids.

AB  - The fungus causing target spot disease, Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & M. A.
      Curtis) C. T. Wei, poses an increasing threat to watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), 
      muskmelon (Cucumis melo), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus); the most economically
      important cucurbit crops grown in China. An understanding of the molecular
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of C. cassiicola is essential for the
      development of new strategies to control this disease-causing fungus.
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) might be useful to
      obtain transformants of C. cassiicola, for the ultimate identification of genes
      involved in pathogenicity. In the present work, we established and optimized an
      ATMT protocol using A. tumefaciens strain AGL-1 carrying the vector pATMT1 for C.
      cassiicola. Efficiency of ATMT was 102-148 transformants per 10(6) conidia and
      successive subculturing of transformants on non-selective and selective media
      demonstrated that the integrated transfer (T)-DNA was stably inherited in C.
      cassiicola transformants. The integration of the hygromycin B phosphotransferase 
      (hph) gene into C. cassiicola was validated by PCR and Southern blot analyses,
      which revealed that nearly 90 % of the transformants contained single-copy T-DNA.
      The transformants with altered phenotypes were characterized. Three of these
      transformants completely lost pathogenicity and other three showed strongly
      impaired pathogenicity relative to the Cc-GX strain on muskmelon leaves. These
      results strongly suggest that ATMT may be used as a molecular tool for
      identifying genes relevant to pathogenicity in the fungus C. cassiicola, an
      emerging threat to several agronomically important plants in China.

TI  - Inactivation of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ActSR system affects resistance to 
      multiple stresses with increased H2O2 sensitivity due to reduced expression of
      hemH.
PG  - 1117-1134
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000838 [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens ActSR two-component regulatory system is a member
      of a homologous group of global redox-responsive regulatory systems that adjust
      the expression of energy-consuming and energy-supplying metabolic pathways in
      order to maintain cellular redox balance. In this study, the transcriptional
      organization of the hrpB-actSR locus was determined and the effect of actSR
      system inactivation on stress resistance was investigated. It was found that hrpB
      is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA and actS is transcribed along with actR as
      a bicistronic mRNA, while actR is also transcribed as a monocistronic message.
      Each message is initiated from a separate promoter. Inactivation of actR resulted
      in decreased resistance to membrane stress (sodium dodecyl sulfate), acid stress 
      (pH 5.5), iron starvation (bipyridyl) and iron excess (FeCl3), and antibiotic
      stress (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin). Resistance to oxidative stress in the
      form of organic peroxide (cumene hydroperoxide) increased, while resistance to
      inorganic peroxide (H2O2) decreased. An actR insertion mutant displayed reduced
      catalase activity, even though transcription of katA and catE remained unchanged.
      Complementation of the actR inactivation mutant with plasmid-encoded actR or
      overexpression of hemH, encoding ferrochelatase, restored wild-type catalase
      activity and H2O2 resistance levels. Gel mobility shift and hemH promoter-lacZ
      fusion results indicated that ActR is a positive regulator of hemH that binds
      directly to the hemH promoter region. Thus, inactivation of the A. tumefaciens
      ActSR system affects resistance to multiple stresses, including reduced
      resistance to H2O2 resulting from a reduction in catalase activity due to reduced
      expression of hemH.

TI  - Efflux proteins MacAB confer resistance to arsenite and penicillin/macrolide-type
      antibiotics in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A.
PG  - 115

AB  - Antibiotic and arsenic (As) contaminations are worldwide public health problems. 
      Previously, the bacterial ABC-type efflux protein MacAB reportedly conferred
      resistance to macrolide-type antibiotics but not to other metal(loid)s. In this
      study, the roles of MacAB for the co-resistance of different antibiotics and
      several metal(loid)s were analyzed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A, a strain
      resistant to arsenite [As(III)] and several types of antibiotics. The macA and
      macB genes were cotranscribed, and macB was deleted in A. tumefaciens 5A and
      heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli AW3110 and E. coli S17-1. Compared
      to the wild-type strain 5A, the macB deletion strain reduced bacterial resistance
      levels to several macrolide-type and penicillin-type antibiotics but not to
      cephalosporin-type antibiotics. In addition, the macB deletion strain showed
      lower resistance to As(III) but not to arsenate [As(V)], antimonite [Sb(III)] and
      cadmium chloride [Cd(II)]. The mutant strain 5A-DeltamacB cells accumulated more 
      As(III) than the cells of the wild-type. Furthermore, heterologous expression of 
      MacAB in E. coli S17-1 showed that MacAB was essential for resistance to
      macrolide, several penicillin-type antibiotics and As(III) but not to As(V).
      Heterologous expression of MacAB in E. coli AW3110 reduced the cellular
      accumulation of As(III) but not of As(V), indicating that MacAB is responsible
      for the efflux of As(III). These results demonstrated that, in addition to
      macrolide-type antibiotics, MacAB also conferred resistance to penicillin-type
      antibiotics and As(III) by extruding them out of cells. This finding contributes 
      to a better understanding of the bacterial resistance mechanisms of antibiotics
      and metal(loid)s.

AB  - In this study, we explored the pathogenicity and phylogenetic position of
      Agrobacterium spp. strains isolated from crown gall tissues on annual, perennial,
      and ornamental plants in Iran. Of the 43 strains studied, 10 strains were
      identified as Allorhizobium vitis (formerly Agrobacterium vitis) using the
      species-specific primer pair PGF/PGR. Thirty-three remaining strains were studied
      using multilocus sequence analysis of four housekeeping genes (i.e., atpD, gyrB, 
      recA, and rpoB), from which seven strains were identified as A. larrymoorei and
      one strain was identified as A. rubi (Rer); the remaining 25 strains were
      scattered within the A. tumefaciens species complex. Two strains were identified 
      as genomospecies 1 (G1), seven strains were identified as A. radiobacter (G4),
      seven strains were identified as A. deltaense (G7), two strains were identified
      as A. nepotum (G14), and one strain was identified as "A. viscosum" (G15). The
      strains Rnr, Rnw, and Rew as well as the two strains OT33 and R13 all isolated
      from rose and the strain Ap1 isolated from apple were clustered in three atypical
      clades within the A. tumefaciens species complex. All but eight strains (i.e.,
      Nec10, Ph38, Ph49, fic9, Fic72, R13, OT33, and Ap1) were pathogenic on tomato and
      sunflower seedlings in greenhouse conditions, whereas all but three strains
      (i.e., fic9, Fic72, and OT33) showed tumorigenicity on carrot root discs. The
      phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide diversity statistics suggested the existence
      of two novel genomospecies within the A. tumefaciens species complex, which we
      named "G19" and "G20." Hence, we propose the strains Rew, Rnw, and Rnr as the
      members of "G19" and the strains R13 and OT33 as the members of G20, whereas the 
      phylogenetic status of the atypical strain Ap1 remains undetermined.

      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens GW4.

AB  - Microbial oxidation of antimonite [Sb(III)] to antimonate [Sb(V)] is a
      detoxification process which contributes to Sb(III) resistance. Antimonite
      oxidase AnoA is essential for Sb(III) oxidation, however, the regulation
      mechanism is still unknown. Recently, we found that the expressions of phosphate 
      transporters were induced by Sb(III) using proteomics analysis in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens GW4, thus, we predicted that the phosphate regulator PhoB may
      regulate bacterial Sb(III) oxidation and resistance. In this study, comprehensive
      analyses were performed and the results showed that (1) Genomic analysis revealed
      two phoB (named as phoB1 and phoB2) and one phoR gene in strain GW4; (2) Reporter
      gene assay showed that both phoB1 and phoB2 were induced in low phosphate
      condition (50 muM), but only phoB2 was induced by Sb(III); (3) Genes
      knock-out/complementation, Sb(III) oxidation and Sb(III) resistance tests showed 
      that deletion of phoB2 significantly inhibited the expression of anoA and
      decreased bacterial Sb(III) oxidation efficiency and Sb(III) resistant. In
      contrast, deletion of phoB1 did not obviously affect anoA's expression level and 
      Sb(III) oxidation/resistance; (4) A putative Pho motif was predicted in several
      A. tumefaciens strains and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed
      that PhoB2 could bind with the promoter sequence of anoA; (5) Site-directed
      mutagenesis and short fragment EMSA revealed the exact DNA binding sequence for
      the protein-DNA interaction. These results showed that PhoB2 positively regulates
      Sb(III) oxidation and PhoB2 is also associated with Sb(III) resistance. Such
      regulation mechanism may provide a great contribution for bacterial survival in
      the environment with Sb and for bioremediation application.

AB  - We present a collection of minimalist binary vectors for transformation through
      ATMT applicable to several fungi species. pLUO plasmid binary vectors consist of 
      a reporter module containing fluorescent proteins, mCherry or eGFP, flanked by a 
      multiple cloning site and a transcription terminator site. They also present a
      synthetic gene allowing resistance to Hygromicin B flanked by alternate
      promoters, one for yeast and another for filamentous fungi. Left and right
      borders were added for Agrobacterium tumefaciens recognition, and a minimal
      broad-host range RK2 replication origin. Transformation was validated in the
      pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides lutzii. Hence, we developed an efficient and
      reliable molecular tool for fungal transformation: minimalist, synthetic,
      modular, and available in four different versions, and these can still be readily
      modified using a few primers and few cloning steps.

AB  - Genetic transformation of host plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and related
      species represents a unique model for natural horizontal gene transfer. Almost
      five decades of studying the molecular interactions between Agrobacterium and its
      host cells have yielded countless fundamental insights into bacterial and plant
      biology, even though several steps of the DNA transfer process remain poorly
      understood. Agrobacterium spp. may utilize different pathways for transferring
      DNA, which likely reflects the very wide host range of Agrobacterium.
      Furthermore, closely related bacterial species, such as rhizobia, are able to
      transfer DNA to host plant cells when they are provided with Agrobacterium DNA
      transfer machinery and T-DNA. Homologs of Agrobacterium virulence genes are found
      in many bacterial genomes, but only one non-Agrobacterium bacterial strain,
      Rhizobium etli CFN42, harbors a complete set of virulence genes and can mediate
      plant genetic transformation when carrying a T-DNA-containing plasmid.

TI  - Ready-to-Use Stocks of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Can Simplify Process Development
      for the Production of Recombinant Proteins by Transient Expression in Plants.
PG  - e1900113
LID - 10.1002/biot.201900113 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale automated transient protein expression in plants requires the
      synchronization of cultivation and bacterial fermentation, especially if more
      than one bacterial strain. Therefore, a ready-to-use approach that decouples
      bacterial fermentation and infiltration is developed. It is found that bacterial 
      cultures can easily be reconstituted in infiltration medium at a user-defined
      time, optical density, and quantity. This allows the process flow to be
      staggered, avoiding bottlenecks in process capacity and labor. Using the red
      fluorescent protein, DsRed, as a model product, the ready-to-use preparations
      achieved the same yields in infiltrated plant biomass as Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens derived from regular fermentations. It is possible to store the
      ready-to-use stocks at -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C for more than two months
      without loss of activity. Using a consolidated cost model for the current
      fermentation process, it is found that the ready-to-use strategy can reduce
      operational costs by 20-95% and investment costs by up to 75%, which would
      otherwise offset the economic advantages of plants over mammalian expression
      systems during upstream production. Furthermore, the staggered cultivation of
      plants and bacteria reduces the likelihood of batch failure and thus increases
      the robustness and flexibility of transient expression for the production of
      recombinant proteins in plants.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization T4- and T7-Like Phages that Infect the Bacterial
      Plant Pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

AB  - In the rhizosphere, bacteria-phage interactions are likely to have important
      impacts on the ecology of microbial communities and microbe-plant interactions.
      To better understand the dynamics of Agrobacteria-phage interactions, we have
      isolated diverse bacteriophages which infect the bacterial plant pathogen,
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Here, we complete the genomic characterization of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens phages Atu_ph04 and Atu_ph08. Atu_ph04-a T4-like phage 
      belonging to the Myoviridae family-was isolated from waste water and has a
      143,349 bp genome that encodes 223 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Based on
      phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome alignments, Atu_ph04 is a member of a
      newly described T4 superfamily that contains other Rhizobiales-infecting phages. 
      Atu_ph08, a member of the Podoviridae T7-like family, was isolated from waste
      water, has a 59,034 bp genome, and encodes 75 ORFs. Based on phylogenetic
      analysis and whole-genome alignments, Atu_ph08 may form a new T7 superfamily
      which includes Sinorhizobium phage PCB5 and Ochrobactrum phage POI1126. Atu_ph08 
      is predicted to have lysogenic activity, as we found evidence of an integrase and
      several transcriptional repressors with similarity to proteins in transducing
      phage P22. Together, this data suggests that Agrobacterium phages are diverse in 
      morphology, genomic content, and lifestyle.

TI  - Regulation and function of the flavonoid-inducible efflux system, emrR-emrAB, in 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
PG  - 5763-5780
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-09899-5 [doi]
AB  - The expression of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens emrAB operon, which encodes a
      membrane fusion protein and an inner membrane protein, is inducible by various
      flavonoids, including apigenin, genistein, luteolin, naringenin, and quercetin.
      Among these flavonoids, quercetin is the best inducer, followed by genistein. The
      emrR gene is divergently transcribed from the emrAB operon. The EmrR protein,
      which belongs to the TetR transcriptional regulator family, negatively regulates 
      the expression of emrAB and of itself. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and 
      DNase I footprinting showed that EmrR binds directly at two EmrR-binding sites in
      the emrR-emrAB intergenic region and that quercetin inhibits the DNA-binding
      activity of EmrR. Promoter-lacZ fusion analyses and 5' rapid amplification of
      cDNA ends were performed to map the emrR and emrAB promoters. Compared with the
      wild-type strain, the emrA mutant strain exhibited similar levels of resistance
      to the tested antibiotics. In contrast, disruption of emrR conferred protection
      against nalidixic acid and novobiocin, but it rendered A. tumefaciens sensitive
      to tetracycline and erythromycin. The emrR mutation also destabilized the outer
      membrane of A. tumefaciens, resulting in increased sensitivity to SDS and low pH.
      These findings demonstrate that proper regulation of emrR-emrAB is required for
      free-living A. tumefaciens to survive in deleterious environments in which toxic 
      compounds are present. Nonetheless, A. tumefaciens strains that lack emrR or emrA
      still have the ability to cause tumors when infecting Nicotiana benthamiana
      plants.

TI  - Glycoside Hydrolase Genes Are Required for Virulence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      on Bryophyllum daigremontiana and Tomato.
LID - e00603-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00603-19 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a rhizosphere bacterium that can infect wound sites 
      on plants. The bacterium transfers a segment of DNA (T-DNA) from the Ti plasmid
      to the plant host cell via a type IV secretion system where the DNA becomes
      integrated into the host cell chromosomes. The expression of T-DNA in the plant
      results in tumor formation. Although the binding of the bacteria to plant
      surfaces has been studied previously, there is little work on possible
      interactions of the bacteria with the plant cell wall. Seven of the 48 genes
      encoding putative glycoside hydrolases (Atu2295, Atu2371, Atu3104, Atu3129,
      Atu4560, Atu4561, and Atu4665) in the genome of A. tumefaciens C58 were found to 
      play a role in virulence on tomato and Bryophyllum daigremontiana Two of these
      genes (pglA and pglB; Atu3129 and Atu4560) encode enzymes capable of digesting
      polygalacturonic acid and, thus, may play a role in the digestion of pectin. One 
      gene (arfA; Atu3104) encodes an arabinosylfuranosidase, which could remove
      arabinose from the ends of polysaccharide chains. Two genes (bglA and bglB;
      Atu2295 and Atu4561) encode proteins with beta-glycosidase activity and could
      digest a variety of plant cell wall oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. One
      gene (xynA; Atu2371) encodes a putative xylanase, which may play a role in the
      digestion of xylan. Another gene (melA; Atu4665) encodes a protein with
      alpha-galactosidase activity and may be involved in the breakdown of
      arabinogalactans. Limited digestion of the plant cell wall by A. tumefaciens may 
      be involved in tumor formation on tomato and B. daigremontiana IMPORTANCE A.
      tumefaciens is used in the construction of genetically engineered plants, as it
      is able to transfer DNA to plant hosts. Knowledge of the mechanisms of DNA
      transfer and the genes required will aid in the understanding of this process.
      Manipulation of glycoside hydrolases may increase transformation and widen the
      host range of the bacterium. A. tumefaciens also causes disease (crown gall
      tumors) on a variety of plants, including stone fruit trees, grapes, and grafted 
      ornamentals such as roses. It is possible that compounds that inhibit glycoside
      hydrolases could be used to control crown gall disease caused by A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Cyclic di-GMP inactivates T6SS and T4SS activity in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 632-648
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14279 [doi]
AB  - The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a bacterial nanomachine that delivers
      effector proteins into prokaryotic and eukaryotic preys. This secretion system
      has emerged as a key player in regulating the microbial diversity in a
      population. In the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the signalling
      cascades regulating the activity of this secretion system are poorly understood. 
      Here, we outline how the universal eubacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP
      impacts the production of T6SS toxins and T6SS structural components. We
      demonstrate that this has a significant impact on the ability of the
      phytopathogen to compete with other bacterial species in vitro and in planta. Our
      results suggest that, as opposed to other bacteria, c-di-GMP turns down the T6SS 
      in A. tumefaciens thus impacting its ability to compete with other bacterial
      species within the rhizosphere. We also demonstrate that elevated levels of
      c-di-GMP within the cell decrease the activity of the Type IV secretion system
      (T4SS) and subsequently the capacity of A. tumefaciens to transform plant cells. 
      We propose that such peculiar control reflects on c-di-GMP being a key second
      messenger that silences energy-costing systems during early colonization phase
      and biofilm formation, while low c-di-GMP levels unleash T6SS and T4SS to advance
      plant colonization.

TI  - GROWTH POLE RING protein forms a 200-nm-diameter ring structure essential for
      polar growth and rod shape in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 10962-10967
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1905900116 [doi]
AB  - Polar growth in Agrobacterium pirates and repurposes well-known bacterial cell
      cycle proteins, such as FtsZ, FtsA, PopZ, and PodJ. Here we identify a heretofore
      unknown protein that we name GROWTH POLE RING (GPR) due to its striking
      localization as a hexameric ring at the growth pole during polar growth. GPR also
      localizes at the midcell late in the cell cycle just before division, where it is
      then poised to be precisely localized at new growth poles in sibling cells. GPR
      is 2,115 aa long, with two N-terminal transmembrane domains placing the bulk of
      the protein in the cytoplasm, N- and C-terminal proline-rich disordered regions, 
      and a large 1,700-aa central region of continuous alpha-helical domains. This
      latter region contains 12 predicted adjacent or overlapping apolipoprotein
      domains that may function to sequester lipids during polar growth. Stable genetic
      deletion or riboswitch-controlled depletion results in spherical cells that grow 
      poorly; thus, GPR is essential for wild-type growth and morphology. As GPR has no
      predicted enzymatic domains and it forms a distinct 200-nm-diameter ring, we
      propose that GPR is a structural component of an organizing center for
      peptidoglycan and membrane syntheses critical for cell envelope formation during 
      polar growth. GPR homologs are found in numerous Rhizobiales; thus, our results
      and proposed model are fundamental to understanding polar growth strategy in a
      variety of bacterial species.

TI  - Acquirement of CRY8DB Transgenic Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) by
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens to Develop Resistance Against Pentodon idiota Herbest.
PG  - 528-540
LID - 10.1007/s12033-019-00183-5 [doi]
AB  - Tall fescue plants are widely exposed to white grubs. Regarding the rate of
      damage caused by the white grubs to tall fescue and difficulty of its ecological 
      and economical control, production of resistant cultivars is a priority. In this 
      experiment, for the first time, we report production of transgenic lines
      resistant to white grub using CR8DB gene. For this, mature seeds were placed on
      MS basal medium with 0-15 mg L(-1) 2,4-D for callogenesis and 0-1.75 mg L(-1) BA 
      for regeneration. 'Asterix' (54.11%) in 7.5 and 'Talladega' (52.53%) in 10 mg
      L(-1) 2,4-D showed maximum callogenesis. Regeneration percentage was higher in
      0.5 mg L(-1) BA. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harbouring binary
      vector pCAMBIA 1301 with CRY8DB gene, which contains HPTII gene and uidA and
      various types MS media were used for transformation of calli. The highest
      percentage of gus enzyme activity and hygromycin resistance in calli was related 
      to the modified medium type 11. The PCR and RT-PCR analysis was done to confirm
      the presence and expression of the target gene in transgenic 5 lines in 'Asterix'
      and 3 lines in 'Talladega'. According to bioassay, larvae mortality of 91.66% was
      observed in transgenic plants, whereas it was 15.52% in control plants.

TI  - The transcription factors ActR and SoxR differentially affect the phenazine
      tolerance of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 199-218
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14263 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria in soils encounter redox-active compounds, such as phenazines, that can 
      generate oxidative stress, but the mechanisms by which different species tolerate
      these compounds are not fully understood. Here, we identify two transcription
      factors, ActR and SoxR, that play contrasting yet complementary roles in the
      tolerance of the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens to phenazines. We show 
      that ActR promotes phenazine tolerance by proactively driving expression of a
      more energy-efficient terminal oxidase at the expense of a less efficient
      alternative, which may affect the rate at which phenazines abstract electrons
      from the electron transport chain (ETC) and thereby generate reactive oxygen
      species. SoxR, on the other hand, responds to phenazines by inducing expression
      of several efflux pumps and redox-related genes, including one of three copies of
      superoxide dismutase and five novel members of its regulon that could not be
      computationally predicted. Notably, loss of ActR is far more detrimental than
      loss of SoxR at low concentrations of phenazines, and also increases dependence
      on the otherwise functionally redundant SoxR-regulated superoxide dismutase. Our 
      results thus raise the intriguing possibility that the composition of an
      organism's ETC may be the driving factor in determining sensitivity or tolerance 
      to redox-active compounds.

TI  - An Enzymolysis-Assisted Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation Method 
      for the Yeast-Like Cells of Tremella fuciformis.
PG  - 59-65
LID - 10.1080/12298093.2018.1559121 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT), as a simple and
      versatile method, achieves successful transformation in the yeast-like cells
      (YLCs) of Tremella fuciformis with lower efficiency. Establishment of a more
      efficient transformation system of YLCs is important for functional genomics
      research and biotechnological application. In this study, an enzymolysis-assisted
      ATMT method was developed. The degradation degree of YLCs depends on the
      concentration and digestion time of Lywallzyme. Lower concentration (</=0.1%) of 
      Lywallzyme was capable of formation of limited wounds on the surface of YLCs and 
      has less influence on their growth. In addition, there is no significant
      difference of YLCs growth among groups treated with 0.1% Lywallzyme for different
      time. The binary vector pGEH under the control of T. fuciformis
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gpd) promoter was utilized to
      transform the enzymolytic wounded YLCs with different concentrations and
      digestion time. The results of PCR, Southern blot, quantitative real-time PCR
      (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the T-DNA was integrated into
      the YLCs genome, suggesting an efficient enzymolysis-assisted ATMT method of YLCs
      was established. The highest transformation frequency reached 1200 transformants 
      per 10(6) YLCs by 0.05% (w/v) Lywallzyme digestion for 15 min, and the
      transformants were genetically stable. Compared with the mechanical wounding
      methods, enzymolytic wounding is thought to be a tender, safer and more effective
      method.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-Mediated Transformation of
      Potato and the Promoter Activity of a Suberin Gene by GUS Staining.
LID - 10.3791/59119 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium sp. is one of the most widely used methods to obtain transgenic
      plants as it has the ability to transfer and integrate its own T-DNA into the
      plant's genome. Here, we present two transformation systems to genetically modify
      potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants. In A. tumefaciens transformation, leaves are
      infected, the transformed cells are selected and a new complete transformed plant
      is regenerated using phytohormones in 18 weeks. In A. rhizogenes transformation, 
      stems are infected by injecting the bacteria with a needle, the new emerged
      transformed hairy roots are detected using a red fluorescent marker and the
      non-transformed roots are removed. In 5-6 weeks, the resulting plant is a
      composite of a wild type shoot with fully developed transformed hairy roots. To
      increase the biomass, the transformed hairy roots can be excised and
      self-propagated. We applied both Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods to
      obtain roots expressing the GUS reporter gene driven by a suberin biosynthetic
      gene promoter. The GUS staining procedure is provided and allows the cell
      localization of the promoter induction. In both methods, the transformed potato
      roots showed GUS staining in the suberized endodermis and exodermis, and
      additionally, in A. rhizogenes transformed roots the GUS activity was also
      detected in the emergence of lateral roots. These results suggest that A.
      rhizogenes can be a fast alternative tool to study the genes that are expressed
      in roots.

TI  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens atu3184 gene, a member of the COG0523 family of
      GTPases, is regulated by the transcriptional repressor Zur.

LID - S0944-5013(18)31376-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.micres.2019.02.008 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome revealed a potential Zur
      (zinc uptake regulator) binding site (5'-GATATGTTATTACATTAC-3', the underlined
      letters are the center of symmetry of the inverted palindrome) located in the
      upstream region of atu3184, whose gene product is a member of the COG0523
      subfamily of G3E GTPases. The specific interaction of the Zur protein with the
      18-bp inverted repeat operator motif in the presence of zinc was demonstrated in 
      vitro by a DNA band shift assay and a DNase I footprinting assay. A LacZ reporter
      fusion assay further confirmed that Zur negatively regulates atu3184 promoter
      activity in vivo. The expression of atu3184 was upregulated in response to zinc
      limitation in the wild-type strain, but the zur mutant strain exhibited
      high-level constitutive expression of atu3184 under all conditions, irrespective 
      of the zinc levels. It is likely that A. tumefaciens Zur senses zinc and directly
      regulates the atu3184 promoter by a molecular mechanism similar to that of
      Escherichia coli Zur, where the operator DNA is surrounded by four Zur monomers
      forming two dimers bound on the opposite sides of the DNA duplex. Disruption of
      atu3184 did not affect cell growth under metal-limited conditions and had no
      effect on the total cellular zinc content. Furthermore, an A. tumefaciens strain 
      lacking atu3184 caused a tumor disease in a host plant.

TI  - 6-Hydroxypseudooxynicotine Dehydrogenase Delivers Electrons to Electron Transfer 
      Flavoprotein during Nicotine Degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
LID - e00454-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00454-19 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 degrades nicotine via a novel hybrid of the
      pyridine and the pyrrolidine pathways. The hybrid pathway consists of at least
      six steps involved in oxidoreductive reactions before the N-heterocycle can be
      broken down. Collectively, the six steps allow electron transfer from nicotine
      and its intermediates to the final acceptor O2 via the electron transport chain
      (ETC). 6-Hydroxypseudooxynicotine oxidase, renamed 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine
      dehydrogenase in this study, has been characterized as catalyzing the fourth step
      using the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. Here, we
      used biochemical, genetic, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
      analyses to determine that 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine dehydrogenase utilizes the 
      electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) as the physiological electron acceptor to 
      catalyze the dehydrogenation of pseudooxynicotine, an analogue of the true
      substrate 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine, in vivo, into
      3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine. NAD(P)(+), O2, and ferredoxin could not
      function as electron acceptors. The oxygen atom in the aldehyde group of the
      product 3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine was verified to be derived from H2O.
      Disruption of the etfAB genes in the nicotine-degrading gene cluster decreased
      the growth rate of A. tumefaciens S33 on nicotine but not on
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine, an intermediate downstream of the hybrid pathway, 
      indicating the requirement of EtfAB for efficient nicotine degradation. The
      electrons were found to be further transferred from the reduced EtfAB to coenzyme
      Q by the catalysis of electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase.
      These results aid in an in-depth understanding of the electron transfer process
      and energy metabolism involved in the nicotine oxidation and provide novel
      insights into nicotine catabolism in bacteria.IMPORTANCE Nicotine has been
      studied as a model for toxic N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds. Microorganisms
      can catabolize nicotine via various pathways and conserve energy from its
      oxidation. Although several oxidoreductases have been characterized to
      participate in nicotine degradation, the electron transfer involved in these
      processes is poorly understood. In this study, we found that
      6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the hybrid pyridine and
      pyrrolidine pathway for nicotine degradation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33,
      utilizes EtfAB as a physiological electron acceptor. Catalyzed by the
      membrane-associated electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the
      electrons are transferred from the reduced EtfAB to coenzyme Q, which then could 
      enter into the classic ETC. Thus, the route for electron transport from the
      substrate to O2 could be constructed, by which ATP can be further sythesized via 
      chemiosmosis to support the baterial growth. These findings provide new knowledge
      regarding the catabolism of N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds in microorganisms.

TI  - The RNase YbeY Is Vital for Ribosome Maturation, Stress Resistance, and Virulence
      of the Natural Genetic Engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e00730-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00730-18 [doi]
AB  - Riboregulation involving regulatory RNAs, RNA chaperones, and ribonucleases is
      fundamental for the rapid adaptation of gene expression to changing environmental
      conditions. The gene coding for the RNase YbeY belongs to the minimal prokaryotic
      genome set and has a profound impact on physiology in a wide range of bacteria.
      Here, we show that the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ybeY gene is not essential.
      Deletion of the gene in the plant pathogen reduced growth, motility, and stress
      tolerance. Most interestingly, YbeY is crucial for A. tumefaciens-mediated T-DNA 
      transfer and tumor formation. Comparative proteomics by using isobaric tags for
      relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) revealed dysregulation of 59 proteins,
      many of which have previously been found to be dependent on the RNA chaperone
      Hfq. YbeY and Hfq have opposing effects on production of these proteins.
      Accumulation of a 16S rRNA precursor in the ybeY mutant suggests that A.
      tumefaciens YbeY is involved in rRNA processing. RNA
      coimmunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-Seq) showed binding of YbeY to the region
      immediately upstream of the 16S rRNA. Purified YbeY is an oligomer with RNase
      activity. It does not physically interact with Hfq and thus plays a partially
      overlapping but distinct role in the riboregulatory network of the plant
      pathogen.IMPORTANCE Although ybeY gene belongs to the universal bacterial core
      genome, its biological function is incompletely understood. Here, we show that
      YbeY is critical for fitness and host-microbe interaction in the plant pathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens Consistent with the reported endoribonuclease activity 
      of YbeY, A. tumefaciens YbeY acts as a RNase involved in maturation of 16S rRNA. 
      This report adds a worldwide plant pathogen and natural genetic engineer of
      plants to the growing list of bacteria that require the conserved YbeY protein
      for host-microbe interaction.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a novel multiprotein needle-like apparatus
      that is distributed widely in Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria harboring T6SSs
      inject various effectors into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells for
      interspecies competition or virulence-related processes. The toxicities of the
      effectors can be neutralized by their cognate immunity proteins. Tde1
      (Atu4350)-Tdi1 (Atu4351) has recently been characterized as a T6SS
      effector-immunity pair in the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the
      neutralization mechanism remains unknown. Here, the crystal structure of the
      immunity protein Tdi1 was determined at 2.40 A resolution by the
      single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Structural analysis suggested that
      it is composed of a GAD-like domain and an inserted DUF1851 domain, and both
      domains show low structural similarities to known structures. There is a positive
      groove mainly located in the GAD-like domain that may be associated with
      nucleotide binding. The structure provides a basis for further study of the
      positive groove as a potential active site.

TI  - Plant-Pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens Strains Have Diverse Type VI
      Effector-Immunity Pairs and Vary in In-Planta Competitiveness.
PG  - 961-971
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-01-19-0021-R [doi]
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is used by gram-negative bacteria to
      translocate effectors that can antagonize other bacterial cells. Models predict
      the variation in collections of effector and cognate immunity genes determine
      competitiveness and can affect the dynamics of populations and communities of
      bacteria. However, the outcomes of competition cannot be entirely explained by
      compatibility of effector-immunity (EI) pairs. Here, we characterized the
      diversity of T6SS loci of plant-pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens and showed
      that factors other than EI pairs can impact interbacterial competition. All
      examined strains encode T6SS active in secretion and antagonism against
      Escherichia coli. The spectra of EI pairs as well as compositions of gene
      neighborhoods are diverse. Almost 30 in-planta competitions were tested between
      different genotypes of A. tumefaciens. Fifteen competitions between members of
      different species-level groups resulted in T6SS-dependent suppression in
      in-planta growth of prey genotypes. In contrast, ten competitions between members
      within species-level groups resulted in no significant effect on the growth of
      prey genotypes. One strain was an exceptional case and, despite encoding a
      functional T6SS and toxic effector protein, could not compromise the growth of
      the four tested prey genotypes. The data suggest T6SS-associated EI pairs can
      influence the competitiveness of strains of A. tumefaciens, but genetic features 
      have a significant role on the efficacy of interbacterial antagonism.

TI  - In vitro plant regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      of Datura stramonium (Solanaceae).

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Datura stramonium is a pharmacologically and evolutionarily
      important plant species in the family Solanaceae. Stable transformation
      methodology of this species would be advantageous for future genetic studies.
      METHODS: In vitro plant regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation techniques were developed for D. stramonium based on methods
      reported for tomato. A binary vector containing pAtUBQ10::erGFP was used for
      transformation. RESULTS: We recovered primary transformants harboring the green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene that resulted in expression of fluorescence
      in all tissues analyzed. Transformants were allowed to self-pollinate, and two of
      five progeny contained the GFP transgene and displayed fluorescence identical to 
      the primary transformants. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated the first stable
      transformation in the genus Datura. This is a key first step to study the genetic
      basis of traits in this evolutionarily interesting species.

TI  - Transcriptomics analysis defines global cellular response of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens 5A to arsenite exposure regulated through the histidine kinases PhoR 
      and AioS.
PG  - 2659-2676
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14577 [doi]
AB  - In environments where arsenic and microbes coexist, microbes are the principal
      drivers of arsenic speciation, which directly affects bioavailability, toxicity
      and bioaccumulation. Speciation reactions influence arsenic behaviour in
      environmental systems, directly affecting human and agricultural exposures.
      Arsenite oxidation decreases arsenic toxicity and mobility in the environment,
      and therefore understanding its regulation and overall influence on cellular
      metabolism is of significant interest. The arsenite oxidase (AioBA) is regulated 
      by a three-component signal transduction system AioXSR, which is in turn
      regulated by the phosphate stress response, with PhoR acting as the master
      regulator. Using RNA-sequencing, we characterized the global effects of arsenite 
      on gene expression in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. To further elucidate
      regulatory controls, mutant strains for histidine kinases PhoR and AioS were
      employed, and illustrate that in addition to arsenic metabolism, a host of other 
      functional responses are regulated in parallel. Impacted functions include
      arsenic and phosphate metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, solute transport
      systems and iron metabolism, in addition to others. These findings contribute
      significantly to the current understanding of the metabolic impact and genetic
      circuitry involved during arsenite exposure in bacteria. This informs how arsenic
      contamination will impact microbial activities involving several biogeochemical
      cycles in nature.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen which provokes galls on roots and
      stems (crown-gall disease) and colonizes them. Two approaches combining omics
      were used to decipher the lifestyle of A. tumefaciens in plant tumors: an
      integrative approach when omics were used on A. tumefaciens cells collected from 
      plant tumors, a deconvolution approach when omics were used on A. tumefaciens
      cells exploiting a single tumor metabolite in pure culture assay. This addendum
      highlights some recent results on the biotroph lifestyle of A. tumefaciens in
      plant tumors.

AB  - A protocol for genetic transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and
      production of transgenic Dendrobium lasianthera has been developed for the first 
      time. The 8-week-old protocorm explants were used as target of transformation
      with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 carrying plasmid pG35SKNAT1.
      Several parameters such as infection period, Agrobacterium density, concentration
      of acetosyringone, and co-cultivation period were evaluated for the
      transformation efficiency. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT) with p<0.05.
      Subsequently, KNAT1 gene expression was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) analysis. The highest efficiency of transformation (70%) obtained from
      protocorm explants infected with Agrobacterium culture was at the OD600
      concentration of 0.6 for 30min, and co-cultivated with acetosyringone 100microM
      for 5days. The results of confirmation by PCR analysis show that the KNAT1 gene
      has been integrated and expressed in the genome of Dendrobium lasianthera
      transgenic.

      growth to cell division.
PG  - 1074-1092
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14212 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms that restrict peptidoglycan biosynthesis to the pole during
      elongation and re-direct peptidoglycan biosynthesis to mid-cell during cell
      division in polar-growing Alphaproteobacteria are largely unknown. Here, we
      explore the role of early division proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      including three FtsZ homologs, FtsA and FtsW in the transition from polar growth 
      to mid-cell growth and ultimately cell division. Although two of the three FtsZ
      homologs localize to mid-cell, exhibit GTPase activity and form co-polymers, only
      one, FtsZAT , is required for cell division. We find that FtsZAT is required not 
      only for constriction and cell separation, but also for initiation of
      peptidoglycan synthesis at mid-cell and cessation of polar peptidoglycan
      biosynthesis. Depletion of FtsZAT in A. tumefaciens causes a striking phenotype: 
      cells are extensively branched and accumulate growth active poles through tip
      splitting events. When cell division is blocked at a later stage by depletion of 
      FtsA or FtsW, polar growth is terminated and ectopic growth poles emerge from
      mid-cell. Overall, this work suggests that A. tumefaciens FtsZ makes distinct
      contributions to the regulation of polar growth and cell division.

TI  - Reciprocal control of motility and biofilm formation by the PdhS2 two-component
      sensor kinase of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 146-162
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000758 [doi]
AB  - A core regulatory pathway that directs developmental transitions and cellular
      asymmetries in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves two overlapping, integrated
      phosphorelays. One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine
      sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1 and PdhS2, and two response
      regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway
      influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the
      phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor
      kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the
      current study, the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2
      directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue implicated in
      phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and
      motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly
      affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one
      of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional
      control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 may function
      independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA,
      which is inhibited by DivK. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant
      reveals a restricted regulon, most likely functioning through CtrA to separately 
      control motility and regulate the levels of the intracellular signal cyclic
      diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting the production of adhesive
      polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA
      regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through the addition
      of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to 
      the soil microenvironment.

AB  - Nanotechnology, new fascinating field of science, is bringing many application's 
      options. However, it is necessary to understand their potential environmental
      risk and toxicity. Zinc selenide quantum dots (ZnSe QDs) are getting valuable due
      to wide industrial usage, mainly as cadmium free diodes or stabilizing ligand.
      Thanks to unique properties, they could also open the possibilities of
      application in the agriculture. Their effects on living organisms, including
      plants, are still unknown. Therefore, the attention of this work was given to
      antioxidant response of Arabidopsis thaliana to 100 and 250 muM ZnSe QDs foliar
      feeding. ZnSe QDs treatment had no statistically significant differences in
      morphology but led to increased antioxidant response in the leaves at the level
      of gene expression and production secondary antioxidant metabolites.
      Concurrently, analysis of growth properties of Agrobacterium tumefaciens was
      done. 250 muM ZnSe solution inhibited the Agrobacterium tumefaciens viability by 
      60%. This is the first mention about effect ZnSe QDs on the plants. Although QDs 
      induced oxidative stress, the apply treatment dose of ZnSe QDs did not have
      significant toxic effect on the plants and even no morphological changes were
      observed. However, the same amount of ZnSe QD induced an inhibitory effect on
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

PG  - 1156-1164

AB  - Nine transformants of Rhodosporidium toruloides with significant changes in the
      carotenoid profile were obtained by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation, including a white, three red, and four yellow mutants. A red
      mutant A1-15-BRQ that showed a high torularhodin production was selected for
      culture condition optimization. Results indicated that the torularhodin yield was
      boosted with glucose as the carbon source, at a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 22, a
      loading volume of 75 mL, and 28 degrees C. The torularhodin yield of 21.3 mg/L
      consisting of 94.4% total carotenoids was obtained by Box-Behnken design
      experiments. The torularhodin yield was 17.0-fold higher than that of the wild
      type, with time shortened from 9 to 3 days. This study reports an effective
      strategy for improving torularhodin production and provides a candidate R.
      toruloides strain for highly selective production of torularhodin.

AB  - Currently, the genetic modification of Aspergillus oryzae is mainly dependent on 
      protoplastmediated transformation (PMT). In this study, we established a dual
      selection marker system in an industrial A. oryzae 3.042 strain by using
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT). We first constructed a 
      uridine/uracil auxotrophic A. oryzae 3.042 strain and a pyrithiamine
      (PT)-resistance binary vector. Then, we established the ATMT system by using
      uridine/uracil auxotrophy and PT-resistance genes as selection markers. Finally, 
      a dual selection marker ATMT system was developed. This study demonstrates a
      useful dual selection marker transformation system for genetic manipulations of
      A. oryzae 3.042.

TI  - Efficient Transformation of the White Jelly Mushroom Tremella fuciformis
      (Tremellomycetes) and Its Companion Fungus Annulohypoxylon stygium (Ascomycetes) 
      Mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 921-930
LID - 10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2019031600 [doi]
AB  - Tremella fuciformis is an edible white jelly mushroom with medicinal qualities.
      The formation of T. fuciformis fruiting bodies is highly dependent on the
      presence of Annulohypoxylon stygium under natural conditions and during
      artificial cultivation. A lack of efficient transformation systems restricts the 
      ability of researchers to functionally characterize the genes in these two
      interacting fungi. In this study, we tested the utility of the Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation of T. fuciformis and A. stygium protoplasts. 
      A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 cells harboring the pTrGEH plasmid, which contains
      genes for enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) and hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase (hph), was co-cultured with T. fuciformis protoplasts.
      Meanwhile, EHA105 cells harboring the pAnGRH plasmid, which contains the red
      fluorescent protein (rfp) and hph genes, was co-cultured with A. stygium
      protoplasts. The egfp, rfp, and hph genes were under the control of the promoter 
      for gpd, which encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Optimal
      co-cultivation was achieved with a 1:1 mixture of bacteria (OD600 0.4-0.6) and
      fungal protoplasts (105/mL) incubated at 25 degrees C in a medium containing 200 
      muM acetosyringone. The subsequent selection on hygromycin B-containing medium
      yielded 45 and 187 stable transformants per 105 protoplasts for T. fuciformis and
      A. stygium, respectively. The integration of the transformed DNA into the two
      fungal genomes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot
      analysis, fluorescence imaging, and a quantitative real-time PCR. All results
      confirmed the feasibility of our transformation approach, which may facilitate
      future functional analyses of T. fuciformis and A. stygium genes.

TI  - Structural basis for two efficient modes of agropinic acid opine import into the 
      bacterial pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 165-178
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20180861 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens pathogens genetically modify their host plants to drive
      the synthesis of opines in plant tumors. The mannityl-opine family encompasses
      mannopine, mannopinic acid, agropine and agropinic acid. These opines serve as
      nutrients and are imported into bacteria via periplasmic-binding proteins (PBPs) 
      in association with ABC transporters. Structural and affinity data on agropine
      and agropinic acid opines bound to PBPs are currently lacking. Here, we
      investigated the molecular basis of AgtB and AgaA, proposed as the specific PBP
      for agropine and agropinic acid import, respectively. Using genetic approaches
      and affinity measurements, we identified AgtB and its transporter as responsible 
      for agropine uptake in agropine-assimilating agrobacteria. Nonetheless, we showed
      that AgtB binds agropinic acid with a higher affinity than agropine, and we
      structurally characterized the agropinic acid-binding mode through three crystal 
      structures at 1.4, 1.74 and 1.9 A resolution. In the crystallization time course,
      obtaining a crystal structure of AgtB with agropine was unsuccessful due to the
      spontaneous lactamization of agropine into agropinic acid. AgaA binds agropinic
      acid only with a similar affinity in nanomolar range as AgtB. The structure of
      AgaA bound to agropinic acid at 1.65 A resolution defines a different agropinic
      acid-binding signature. Our work highlights the structural and functional
      characteristics of two efficient agropinic acid assimilation pathways, of which
      one is also involved in agropine assimilation.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) comprises needle-shaped multisubunit
      complexes that play a role in the microbial defense systems of Gram-negative
      bacteria. Some Gram-negative bacteria harboring a T6SS deliver toxic effector
      proteins into the cytoplasm or periplasm of competing bacteria in order to lyse
      and kill them. To avoid self-cell disruption, these bacteria have cognate
      immunity proteins that inhibit their toxic effector proteins. T6SS amidase
      effector protein 4 (Tae4) and T6SS amidase immunity protein 4 (Tai4) are a
      representative of the toxic effector-immunity pairs of the T6SS. Here, the
      three-dimensional structures of Tai4 and the Tae4-Tai4 complex from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens are reported at 1.55 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. A structural
      comparison with other Tae4-Tai4 homologs revealed similarities and differences in
      the catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms among the Tae4 and Tai4 family proteins.

TI  - Targeted mutagenesis using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated CRISPR-Cas9
      system in common wheat.
PG  - 302
LID - 10.1186/s12870-018-1496-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used to precisely
      edit plant genomes. Due to the difficulty in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic
      transformation of wheat, the reported applications in CRISPR/Cas9 system were all
      based on the biolistic transformation. RESULTS: In the present study, we
      efficiently applied targeted mutagenesis in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
      protoplasts and transgenic T0 plants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered via
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Seven target sites in three genes (Pinb, waxy and DA1)
      were selected to construct individual expression vectors. The activities of the
      sgRNAs were evaluated by transforming the constructed vectors into wheat
      protoplasts. Mutations in the targets were detected by Illumina sequencing.
      Genome editing, including insertions or deletions at the target sites, was found 
      in the wheat protoplast cells. The highest mutation efficiency was 6.8% in the
      DA1 gene. The CRISPR/Cas9 binary vector targeting the DA1 gene was then
      transformed into common wheat plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation, resulting in efficient target gene editing in the T0 generation. 
      Thirteen mutant lines were generated, and the mutation efficiency was 54.17%.
      Mutations were found in the A and B genomes of the transgenic plants but not in
      the D genome. In addition, off-target mutations were not detected in regions that
      were highly homologous to the sgRNA sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed
      that our Agrobacterium-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used for targeted
      mutations and facilitated wheat genetic improvement.

TI  - The biotroph Agrobacterium tumefaciens thrives in tumors by exploiting a wide
      spectrum of plant host metabolites.

LID - 10.1111/nph.15598 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a niche-constructing biotroph that exploits host
      plant metabolites. We combined metabolomics, transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq),
      transcriptomics, and reverse genetics to characterize A. tumefaciens pathways
      involved in the exploitation of resources from the Solanum lycopersicum host
      plant. Metabolomics of healthy stems and plant tumors revealed the common (e.g.
      sucrose, glutamate) and enriched (e.g. opines, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),
      gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), pyruvate) metabolites that A. tumefaciens could 
      use as nutrients. Tn-seq and transcriptomics pinpointed the genes that are
      crucial and/or upregulated when the pathogen grew on either sucrose (pgi, kdgA,
      pycA, cisY) or GHB (blcAB, pckA, eno, gpsA) as a carbon source. While sucrose
      assimilation involved the Entner-Doudoroff and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathways,
      GHB degradation required the blc genes, TCA cycle, and gluconeogenesis. The
      tumor-enriched metabolite pyruvate is at the node connecting these pathways.
      Using reverse genetics, we showed that the blc, pckA, and pycA loci were
      important for aggressiveness (tumor weight), proliferation (bacterial charge),
      and/or fitness (competition between the constructed mutants and wild-type) of A. 
      tumefaciens in plant tumors. This work highlighted how a biotroph mobilizes its
      central metabolism for exploiting a wide diversity of resources in a plant host. 
      It further shows the complementarity of functional genome-wide scans by
      transcriptomics and Tn-seq to decipher the lifestyle of a plant pathogen.

AB  - Tomato is both an important food crop and serves as a model plant species that is
      used for various research investigations including understanding gene function.
      Transformation is commonly utilized to facilitate these investigations in
      combination with all the extensive genetic and genomic resources available for
      tomato. The transformation protocol routinely used in our laboratory has been
      applied to many different tomato genotypes and relies on Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens infection of young cotyledon sections. We have used vector systems
      for overexpression, RNA interference for gene silencing, and CRISPR/Cas9 for
      genome editing. Vectors used to design gene constructs contained selectable
      marker genes that conferred resistance to kanamycin, hygromycin, and the
      herbicide component, bialaphos. The protocol we follow for Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation of both cultivated and wild species of tomato is detailed in this 
      chapter.

TI  - Structural analysis reveals a pyruvate-binding activator site in the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.

AB  - The pathways for biosynthesis of glycogen in bacteria and starch in plants are
      evolutionarily and biochemically related. They are regulated primarily by
      ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which evolved to satisfy metabolic requirements of
      a particular organism. Despite the importance of these two pathways, little is
      known about the mechanism that controls pyrophosphorylase activity or the
      location of its allosteric sites. Here, we report pyruvate-bound crystal
      structures of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from the bacterium Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, identifying a previously elusive activator site for the enzyme. We
      found that the tetrameric enzyme binds two molecules of pyruvate in a planar
      conformation. Each binding site is located in a crevice between the C-terminal
      domains of two subunits where they stack via a distinct beta-helix region.
      Pyruvate interacts with the side chain of Lys-43 and with the peptide backbone of
      Ser-328 and Gly-329 from both subunits. These structural insights led to the
      design of two variants with altered regulatory properties. In one variant (K43A),
      the allosteric effect was absent, whereas in the other (G329D), the introduced
      Asp mimicked the presence of pyruvate. The latter generated an enzyme that was
      preactivated and insensitive to further activation by pyruvate. Our study
      furnishes a deeper understanding of how glycogen biosynthesis is regulated in
      bacteria and the mechanism by which transgenic plants increased their starch
      production. These insights will facilitate rational approaches to enzyme
      engineering for starch production in crops of agricultural interest and will
      promote further study of allosteric signal transmission and molecular evolution
      in this important enzyme family.

TI  - Lipopeptides from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain 32a as promising biocontrol
      compounds against the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 36518-36529
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-3570-1 [doi]
AB  - Despite the potential biological importance of lipopeptides from Bacillus
      amyloliquefaciens as antimicrobial compounds, their effects on Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens biofilms have not been previously studied. These latter are important
      virulence factors for the development and re-occurrence of crown gall disease. As
      part of the development of a new biopesticide acting as anti-biofilm and
      biocontrol agent, we investigated for the first time the ability of a mixture of 
      lipopeptides produced by B. amyloliquefaciens strain 32a to inhibit the tumor
      formation on plants and to reduce the formation of biofilms by the
      phytopathogenic A. tumefaciens strains C58 and B6. The mixture was found to
      display a strong biosurfactant activity as well as bactericidal activity against 
      planktonic Agrobacterium cells. Moreover, the lipopeptide treatment inhibited
      biofilm formation in the range of 79.58 +/- 0.60-100.00 +/- 0.00% and dislodged
      43.42 +/- 0.91-93.89 +/- 2.70% of preformed biofilm. For these assays,
      fluorescence microscopy did not show any adherent cell in the anti-adhesive assay
      and only few ones in the cell-dislodging assay. More importantly,
      lipopeptide-enriched extract inhibits tumor formation on tomato stem when
      treatments were applied after pathogen adhesion to wounded tissues. By virtue of 
      its ability to inhibit biofilms formed on biotic and abiotic surfaces and to
      control efficiently tumor development, the 32a lipopeptide mixture may represent 
      an excellent new tool for an efficient biocontrol of crown gall disease.

TI  - Virulence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens requires lipid homeostasis mediated by the
      lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol hydrolase AcvB.
PG  - 269-286
LID - 10.1111/mmi.14154 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers oncogenic T-DNA via the type IV secretion
      system (T4SS) into plants causing tumor formation. The acvB gene encodes a
      virulence factor of unknown function required for plant transformation. Here we
      specify AcvB as a periplasmic lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (L-PG) hydrolase, which 
      modulates L-PG homeostasis. Through functional characterization of recombinant
      AcvB variants, we showed that the C-terminal domain of AcvB (residues 232-456) is
      sufficient for full enzymatic activity and defined key residues for catalysis.
      Absence of the hydrolase resulted in ~10-fold increase in L-PG in Agrobacterium
      membranes and abolished T-DNA transfer and tumor formation. Overproduction of the
      L-PG synthase gene (lpiA) in wild-type A. tumefaciens resulted in a similar
      increase in the L-PG content (~7-fold) and a virulence defect even in the
      presence of intact AcvB. These results suggest that elevated L-PG amounts (either
      by overproduction of the synthase or absence of the hydrolase) are responsible
      for the virulence phenotype. Gradually increasing the L-PG content by
      complementation with different acvB variants revealed that cellular L-PG levels
      above 3% of total phospholipids interfere with T-DNA transfer. Cumulatively, this
      study identified AcvB as a novel virulence factor required for membrane lipid
      homeostasis and T-DNA transfer.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of the King Tuber Medicinal
      Mushroom Lentinus tuber-regium (Agaricomycetes).
PG  - 791-796
LID - 10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2018026991 [doi]
AB  - Lentinus tuber-regium is a sclerotium-forming basidiomycetous mushroom. It has
      increasingly aroused people's attention for its medicinal effects. In this study,
      we investigated the applicability of the Agrobacterium tume-faciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) method in L. tuber-regium. A. tumefaciens strain GV 3101
      harboring the vector pPEH was used to transform the mycelium of L. tuber-regium
      strain ACCC50657. The genes for hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) and
      enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) under the control of the
      glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene promoter of Pleurotus
      ostreatus were employed as the selection marker and reporter gene, respectively. 
      The optimal cocultivation temperature and time for transformation were 3 days and
      4 days at 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively. Southern blot analysis
      showed the variation in the copy number and position of hph, which indicated
      random integration of hph. Polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence microscopy 
      indicated that the P. ostreatus gpd promoter can drive the fused hph-egfp gene
      expression in L. tuber-regium. This is the first report that the ATMT method was 
      successfully applied to L. tuber-regium. This reliable and efficient
      transformation method could be a powerful tool for strain genetic improvement and
      gene function study in L. tuber-regium.

TI  - Frond transformation system mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens for Lemna
      minor.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1007/s11103-018-0778-x [doi]
AB  - The Lemnaceae, known as duckweed, the smallest flowering aquatic plant, shows
      promise as a plant bioreactor. For applying this potential plant bioreactor,
      establishing a stable and efficient genetic transformation system is necessary.
      The currently favored callus-based method for duckweed transformation is time
      consuming and genotype limited, as it requires callus culture and regeneration,
      which is inapplicable to many elite duckweed strains suitable for bioreactor
      exploitation. In this study, we attempted to establish a simple frond
      transformation system mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens for Lemna minor, one 
      of the most widespread duckweed species in the world. To evaluate the feasibility
      of the new transformation system, the gene CYP710A11 was overexpressed to improve
      the yield of stigmasterol, which has multiple medicinal purposes. Three L. minor 
      strains, ZH0055, D0158 and M0165, were transformed by both a conventional callus 
      transformation system (CTS) and the simple frond transformation system (FTS). GUS
      staining, PCR, quantitative PCR and stigmasterol content detection showed that
      FTS can produce stable transgenic lines as well as CTS. Moreover, compared to
      CTS, FTS can avoid the genotype constraints of callus induction, thus saving at
      least half of the required processing time (CTS took 8-9 months while FTS took
      approximately 3 months in this study). Therefore, this transformation system is
      feasible in producing stable transgenic lines for a wide range of L. minor
      genotypes.

TI  - Multiple Flagellin Proteins Have Distinct and Synergistic Roles in Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens Motility.
LID - e00327-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00327-18 [doi]
AB  - Rotary flagella propel bacteria through liquid and across semisolid environments.
      Flagella are composed of the basal body that constitutes the motor for rotation, 
      the curved hook that connects to the basal body, and the flagellar filament that 
      propels the cell. Flagellar filaments can be composed of a single flagellin
      protein, such as in Escherichia coli, or made up of multiple flagellins, such as 
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens The four distinct flagellins FlaA, FlaB, FlaC, and
      FlaD produced by wild-type A. tumefaciens are not redundant in function but have 
      specific properties. FlaA and FlaB are much more abundant than FlaC and FlaD and 
      are readily observable in mature flagellar filaments, when either FlaA or FlaB is
      fluorescently labeled. Cells producing FlaA with any one of the other three
      flagellins can generate functional filaments and thus are motile, but FlaA alone 
      cannot constitute a functional filament. In flaA mutants that manifest swimming
      deficiencies, there are multiple ways by which these mutations can be
      phenotypically suppressed. These suppressor mutations primarily occur within or
      upstream of the flaB flagellin gene or in the transcription factor sciP
      regulating flagellin expression. The helical conformation of the flagellar
      filament appears to require a key asparagine residue present in FlaA and absent
      in other flagellins. However, FlaB can be spontaneously mutated to render helical
      flagella in the absence of FlaA, reflecting their overall similarity and perhaps 
      the subtle differences in the specific functions they have evolved to
      fulfill.IMPORTANCE Flagellins are abundant bacterial proteins comprising the
      flagellar filaments that propel bacterial movement. Several members of the
      alphaproteobacterial group express multiple flagellins, in contrast to model
      systems, such as with Escherichia coli, which has one type of flagellin. The
      plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens has four flagellins, the abundant and
      readily detected FlaA and FlaB, and lower levels of FlaC and FlaD. Mutational
      analysis reveals that FlaA requires at least one of the other flagellins to
      function, as flaA mutants produce nonhelical flagella and cannot swim
      efficiently. Suppressor mutations can rescue this swimming defect through
      mutations in the remaining flagellins, including structural changes imparting
      helical shape to the flagella, and putative regulators. Our findings shed light
      on how multiple flagellins contribute to motility.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens Enhances Biosynthesis of Two Distinct Auxins in the
      Formation of Crown Galls.
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcy182 [doi]
AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects plants and introduces the
      transferred-DNA (T-DNA) region of the Ti-plasmid into nuclear DNA of host plants 
      to induce the formation of tumors (crown galls). The T-DNA region carries iaaM
      and iaaH genes for synthesis of the plant hormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid
      (IAA). It has been demonstrated that the iaaM gene encodes a tryptophan
      2-monooxygenase which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to
      indole-3-acetamide (IAM), and the iaaH gene encodes an amidase for subsequent
      conversion of IAM to IAA. In this article, we demonstrate that A. tumefaciens
      enhances the production of both IAA and phenylacetic acid (PAA), another auxin
      which does not show polar transport characteristics, in the formation of crown
      galls. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, we found that the
      endogenous levels of phenylacetamide (PAM) and PAA metabolites, as well as IAM
      and IAA metabolites, are remarkably increased in crown galls formed on the stem
      of tomato plants, implying that two distinct auxins are simultaneously
      synthesized via the IaaM-IaaH pathway. Moreover, we found that the induction of
      the iaaM gene dramatically elevated the levels of PAM, PAA and its metabolites,
      along with IAM, IAA and its metabolites, in Arabidopsis and barley. From these
      results, we conclude that A. tumefaciens enhances biosynthesis of two distinct
      auxins in the formation of crown galls.

TI  - Larger Than Life: Isolation and Genomic Characterization of a Jumbo Phage That
      Infects the Bacterial Plant Pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1861
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01861 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease,
      leading to the damage of agriculturally-important crops. As part of an effort to 
      discover new phages that can potentially be used as biocontrol agents to prevent 
      crown gall disease, we isolated and characterized phage Atu_ph07 from Sawyer
      Creek in Springfield, MO, using the virulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58
      as a host. After surveying its host range, we found that Atu_ph07 exclusively
      infects Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Time-lapse microscopy of A. tumefaciens cells 
      subjected to infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with Atu_ph07
      reveals that lysis occurs within 3 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of
      virions shows that Atu_ph07 has a typical Myoviridae morphology with an
      icosahedral head, long tail, and tail fibers. The sequenced genome of Atu_ph07 is
      490 kbp, defining it as a jumbo phage. The Atu_ph07 genome contains 714 open
      reading frames (ORFs), including 390 ORFs with no discernable homologs in other
      lineages (ORFans), 214 predicted conserved hypothetical proteins with no assigned
      function, and 110 predicted proteins with a functional annotation based on
      similarity to conserved proteins. The proteins with predicted functional
      annotations share sequence similarity with proteins from bacteriophages and
      bacteria. The functionally annotated genes are predicted to encode DNA
      replication proteins, structural proteins, lysis proteins, proteins involved in
      nucleotide metabolism, and tRNAs. Characterization of the gene products reveals
      that Atu_ph07 encodes homologs of 16 T4 core proteins and is closely related to
      Rak2-like phages. Using ESI-MS/MS, the majority of predicted structural proteins 
      could be experimentally confirmed and 112 additional virion-associated proteins
      were identified. The genomic characterization of Atu_ph07 suggests that this
      phage is lytic and the dynamics of Atu_ph07 interaction with its host indicate
      that this phage may be suitable for inclusion in a phage cocktail to be used as a
      biocontrol agent.

AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) method is commonly
      applied in the oleaginous filamentous fungus Mortierella alpina. During the ATMT 
      process, the spores of M. alpina have traditionally been used as a co-cultivation
      material, but their long spore-producing cycle and low sporulation rate make the 
      transformation process tedious. This study explores the use of germinating
      spores, mycelium and single solid colonies of uracil auxotrophic M. alpina
      CCFM501 as a co-cultivation material with A. tumefaciens AGL1. The results show
      that A. tumefaciens AGL1 can successfully transform the germinating spores,
      mycelium and single solid colonies of M. alpina. In addition, the transformation 
      rate of the germinating spores was 50% higher than that of the fresh spores. Due 
      to its concise preparation process, the mycelium was chosen as a co-cultivation
      material for two plasmids of different lengths and proven to be an efficient
      co-cultivation material for M. alpina.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease.
      During infection of the host plant, Agrobacterium transfers T-DNA from its Ti
      plasmid into the host cell, which can then be integrated into the host genome.
      This unique genetic transformation capability has been employed as the dominant
      technology for producing genetically modified plants for both basic research and 
      biotechnological applications. Agrobacterium has been well studied as a
      disease-causing agent. The Agrobacterium-mediated transformation process involves
      early attachment of the bacterium to the host's surface, followed by transfer of 
      T-DNA and virulence proteins into the plant cell. Throughout this process, the
      host plants exhibit dynamic gene expression patterns at each infection stage or
      in response to Agrobacterium strains with varying pathogenic capabilities.
      Shifting host gene expression patterns throughout the transformation process have
      effects on transformation frequency, host morphology, and metabolism. Thus, gene 
      expression profiling during the Agrobacterium infection process can be an
      important approach to help elucidate the interaction between Agrobacterium and
      plants. This review highlights recent findings on host plant differential gene
      expression patterns in response to A. tumefaciens or related elicitor molecules.

TI  - Characterization and regulation of AcrABR, a RND-type multidrug efflux system, in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens AcrR is the transcriptional repressor of the acrABR
      operon. The AcrAB efflux pump confers resistance to various toxic compounds,
      including antibiotics [ciprofloxacin (CIP), nalidixic acid (NAL), novobiocin
      (NOV) and tetracycline (TET)], a detergent [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] and a
      biocide [triclosan (TRI)]. The sequence to which AcrR specifically binds in the
      acrA promoter region was determined by EMSA and DNase I footprinting. The
      AcrR-DNA interaction was abolished by adding NAL, SDS and TRI. Quantitative real 
      time-PCR analysis showed that induction of the acrA transcript occurred when
      wild-type cells were exposed to NAL, SDS and TRI. Indole is a signaling molecule 
      that increases the antibiotic resistance of bacteria, at least in part, through
      activation of efflux pumps. Expression of the A. tumefaciens acrA transcript was 
      also inducible by indole in a dose-dependent manner. Indole induced protection
      against CIP, NAL and SDS but enhanced susceptibility to NOV and TRI.
      Additionally, the TET resistance of A. tumefaciens was not apparently modulated
      by indole. A. tumefaciens AcrAB played a dominant role and was required for
      tolerance to high levels of the toxic compounds. Understanding the regulation of 
      multidrug efflux pumps and bacterial adaptive responses to intracellular and
      extracellular signaling molecules for antibiotic resistance is essential. This
      information will be useful for the rational design of effective treatments for
      bacterial infection to overcome possible multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  - Function and Regulation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Cell Surface Structures that
      Promote Attachment.
PG  - 143-184
LID - 10.1007/82_2018_96 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens attaches stably to plant host tissues and abiotic
      surfaces. During pathogenesis, physical attachment to the site of infection is a 
      prerequisite to infection and horizontal gene transfer to the plant. Virulent and
      avirulent strains may also attach to plant tissue in more benign plant
      associations, and as with other soil microbes, to soil surfaces in the
      terrestrial environment. Although most A. tumefaciens virulence functions are
      encoded on the tumor-inducing plasmid, genes that direct general surface
      attachment are chromosomally encoded, and thus this process is not obligatorily
      tied to virulence, but is a more fundamental capacity. Several different cellular
      structures are known or suspected to contribute to the attachment process. The
      flagella influence surface attachment primarily via their propulsive activity,
      but control of their rotation during the transition to the attached state may be 
      quite complex. A. tumefaciens produces several pili, including the Tad-type Ctp
      pili, and several plasmid-borne conjugal pili encoded by the Ti and At plasmids, 
      as well as the so-called T-pilus, involved in interkingdom horizontal gene
      transfer. The Ctp pili promote reversible interactions with surfaces, whereas the
      conjugal and T-pili drive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) interactions with other 
      cells and tissues. The T-pilus is likely to contribute to physical association
      with plant tissues during DNA transfer to plants. A. tumefaciens can synthesize a
      variety of polysaccharides including cellulose, curdlan (beta-1,3 glucan),
      beta-1,2 glucan (cyclic and linear), succinoglycan, and a localized
      polysaccharide(s) that is confined to a single cellular pole and is called the
      unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). Lipopolysaccharides are also in the outer leaflet 
      of the outer membrane. Cellulose and curdlan production can influence attachment 
      under certain conditions. The UPP is required for stable attachment under a range
      of conditions and on abiotic and biotic surfaces. Other factors that have been
      reported to play a role in attachment include the elusive protein called
      rhicadhesin. The process of surface attachment is under extensive regulatory
      control and can be modulated by environmental conditions, as well as by direct
      responses to surface contact. Complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional
      control circuitry underlies much of the production and deployment of these
      attachment functions.

AB  - Agrobacterium exopolysaccharides play a major role in the life of the cell.
      Exopolysaccharides are required for bacterial growth as a biofilm and they
      protect the bacteria against environmental stresses. Five of the
      exopolysaccharides made by A. tumefaciens have been characterized extensively
      with respect to their structure, synthesis, regulation, and role in the life of
      the bacteria. These are cyclic-beta-(1, 2)-glucan, cellulose, curdlan,
      succinoglycan, and the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP). This chapter describes the 
      structure, synthesis, regulation, and function of these five exopolysaccharides.

LID - 10.21769/BioProtoc.2894 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression has greatly contributed to research
      in molecular plant biology but has low efficiency and inconsistency in
      Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Here, we describe a simple, efficient and
      fast protocol to make transient gene expression in NahG Arabidopsis plants using 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This protocol has been successfully used to assess
      protein sub-cellular localization and accumulation, enzyme activity, and
      protein-protein interaction. In addition, this assay overcomes the use of
      Nicotiana benthamiana plants as a surrogate system for transient gene expression 
      assays. Finally, the use of this protocol does not require complex inoculation
      methods or specific growth conditions, and can be used with different
      Agrobacterium strains with similar results.

      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

LID - 10.1007/82_2018_92 [doi]
AB  - A great diversity of bacterial cell shapes can be found in nature, suggesting
      that cell wall biogenesis is regulated both spatially and temporally. Although
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens has a rod-shaped morphology, the mechanisms underlying 
      cell growth are strikingly different than other well-studied rod-shaped bacteria 
      including Escherichia coli. Technological advances, such as the ability to
      deplete essential genes and the development of fluorescent D-amino acids, have
      enabled recent advances in our understanding of cell wall biogenesis during cell 
      elongation and division of A. tumefaciens. In this review, we address how the
      field has evolved over the years by providing a historical overview of cell
      elongation and division in rod-shaped bacteria. Next, we summarize the current
      understanding of cell growth and cell division processes in A. tumefaciens.
      Finally, we highlight the need for further research to answer key questions
      related to the regulation of cell wall biogenesis in A. tumefaciens.

AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms widely used for the production of
      highly valued compounds, and recently they have been shown to be promising as a
      system for the heterologous expression of proteins. Several transformation
      methods have been successfully developed, from which the Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated method remains the most promising. However, microalgae
      transformation efficiency by A. tumefaciens is shown to vary depending on several
      transformation conditions. The present study aimed to establish an efficient
      genetic transformation system in the green microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta
      using the A. tumefaciens method. The parameters assessed were the infection
      medium, the concentration of the A. tumefaciens and co-culture time. As a
      preliminary screening, the expression of the gusA gene and the viability of
      transformed cells were evaluated and used to calculate a novel parameter called
      Transformation Efficiency Index (TEI). The statistical analysis of TEI values
      showed five treatments with the highest gusA gene expression. To ensure stable
      transformation, transformed colonies were cultured on selective medium using
      hygromycin B and the DNA of resistant colonies were extracted after five
      subcultures and molecularly analyzed by PCR. Results revealed that treatments
      which use solid infection medium, A. tumefaciens OD600=0.5 and co-culture times
      of 72h exhibited the highest percentage of stable gusA expression. Overall, this 
      study established an efficient, optimized A. tumefaciens-mediated genetic
      transformation of D. tertiolecta, which represents a relatively easy procedure
      with no expensive equipment required. This simple and efficient protocol opens
      the possibility for further genetic manipulation of this commercially-important
      microalgae for biotechnological applications.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) has been widely used in 
      filamentous fungi. In this study, an efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation approach was developed for the plant pathogenic fungus, Kabatiella
      zeae, the causative pathogen of eyespot in maize. Five parameters were selected
      to optimize efficiencies of transformation. A. tumefaciens concentration, conidia
      concentration of K. zeae and mixing ratio of A. tumefaciens and K. zeae were
      found to exert a significant influence on all parameters. Transformants emitted
      green fluorescence under fluorescence microscopy. The presence of mitotically
      stable hygromycin resistance gene (hph) integration in the genome was confirmed
      by PCR. Up to 148 transformants per 10(7) conidia could be obtained under optimal
      conditions. In this way, ATMT approach is an efficient tool for insertional
      mutagenesis of K. zeae.

TI  - Lifestyle of the biotroph Agrobacterium tumefaciens in the ecological niche
      constructed on its host plant.
PG  - 350-362
LID - 10.1111/nph.15164 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens constructs an ecological niche in its host plant by
      transferring the T-DNA from its Ti plasmid into the host genome and by diverting 
      the host metabolism. We combined transcriptomics and genetics for understanding
      the A. tumefaciens lifestyle when it colonizes Arabidopsis thaliana tumors.
      Transcriptomics highlighted: a transition from a motile to sessile behavior that 
      mobilizes some master regulators (Hfq, CtrA, DivK and PleD); a remodeling of some
      cell surface components (O-antigen, succinoglucan, curdlan, att genes, putative
      fasciclin) and functions associated with plant defense (Ef-Tu and flagellin
      pathogen-associated molecular pattern-response and glycerol-3-phosphate and
      nitric oxide signaling); and an exploitation of a wide variety of host resources,
      including opines, amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phosphate, phosphorylated
      compounds, and iron. In addition, construction of transgenic A. thaliana lines
      expressing a lactonase enzyme showed that Ti plasmid transfer could escape
      host-mediated quorum-quenching. Finally, construction of knock-out mutants in A. 
      tumefaciens showed that expression of some At plasmid genes seemed more costly
      than the selective advantage they would have conferred in tumor colonization. We 
      provide the first overview of A. tumefaciens lifestyle in a plant tumor and
      reveal novel signaling and trophic interplays for investigating host-pathogen
      interactions.

TI  - Cell regeneration and cyclic catalysis of engineered Kluyveromyces marxianus of a
      D-psicose-3-epimerase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens for D-allulose
      production.
PG  - 65

AB  - D-Allulose as a low-energy and special bioactive monosaccharide sugar is
      essential for human health. In this study, the D-psicose-3-epimerase gene
      (DPEase) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens was transferred into thermotolerant
      Kluyveromyces marxianus to decrease the production cost of D-allulose and reduce 
      the number of manufacturing procedures. The cell regeneration of K. marxianus and
      cyclic catalysis via whole-cell reaction were investigated to achieve the
      sustainable application of K. marxianus and the consumption of residual
      D-fructose. Results showed that DPEase, encoding a 33 kDa protein, could be
      effectively expressed in thermotolerant K. marxianus. The engineered K. marxianus
      produced 190 g L(-1) D-allulose with 750 g L(-1) D-fructose as a substrate at 55 
      degrees C within 12 h. Approximately 100 g of residual D-fructose was converted
      into 34 g of ethanol, and 15 g of the engineered K. marxianus cells was
      regenerated after fermentation at 37 degrees C for 21 h. The purity of D-allulose
      of more than 90% could be obtained without isolating it from D-allulose and
      D-fructose mixture through residual D-fructose consumption. This study provided a
      valuable pathway to regenerate engineered K. marxianus cells and achieve cyclic
      catalysis for D-allulose production.

TI  - Absence of the Min System Does Not Cause Major Cell Division Defects in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 681
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00681 [doi]
AB  - In A. tumefaciens, the essential FtsZ protein is located at the growth pole
      before shifting to the mid-cell right before division. Loss of FtsZ causes a halt
      in cell separation and lysis of cells. To understand how FtsZ polymerization is
      regulated to properly localize the FtsZ ring at the mid-cell, we have conducted a
      systematic characterization of the Min system in A. tumefaciens. Our findings
      indicate that the Min system is not required for cell survival. Yet, we find that
      the deletion of either minE or minCDE results in a broad cell size distribution, 
      including an increase in the proportion of short and long cells. We observe that 
      the site of constriction is misplaced in the minE or minCDE deletion strains
      allowing for short cells to arise from sites of constriction near the cell poles.
      Remarkably, the short cells are viable and contain DNA. In order to observe
      chromosome replication and segregation in these strains, YFP-ParB is used as a
      proxy to track the origin of replication as cells elongate and divide. In the
      absence of the Min proteins, duplication and segregation of the origin of
      replication is frequently delayed. Taken together, our data suggest that the Min 
      system contributes to the proper regulation of FtsZ placement and subsequent cell
      division. Furthermore, the failure to precisely place FtsZ rings at mid-cell in
      the min mutants impacts other cell cycle features including chromosome
      segregation.

AB  - A new aerobic bacterium TN71 was isolated from Tunisian Saharan soil and has been
      selected for its antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic bacteria. Based
      on cellular morphology, physiological characterization and phylogenetic analysis,
      this isolate has been assigned as Streptomyces sp. TN71 strain. In an attempt to 
      increase its anti-Agrobacterium tumefaciens activity, GYM + S (glucose, yeast
      extract, malt extract and starch) medium was selected out of five different
      production media and the medium composition was optimized. Plackett-Burman design
      (PBD) was used to select starch, malt extract and glucose as parameters having
      significant effects on antibacterial activity and a Box-Behnken design was
      applied for further optimization. The analysis revealed that the optimum
      concentrations for anti-A. tumefaciens activity of the tested variables were
      19.49g/L for starch, 5.06g/L for malt extract and 2.07g/L for glucose. Several
      Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the Radial 
      basis function (RBF) were also constructed to predict anti-A. tumefaciens
      activity. The comparison between experimental with predicted outputs from ANN and
      Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were studied. ANN model presents an
      improvement of 12.36% in terms of determination coefficients of anti A.
      tumefaciens activity. To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the
      statistical versus artificial intelligence based modeling for optimization of
      bioactive molecules against phytopathogens.

AB  - Agrobacterium infection and regeneration of the putatively transformed plant from
      the explant remains arduous for some crop species like peanut. Henceforth, a
      competent and reproducible in planta genetic transformation protocol is
      established for peanut cv. CO7 by standardizing various factors such as
      pre-culture duration, acetosyringone concentration, duration of co-cultivation,
      sonication and vacuum infiltration. In the present investigation, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring the binary vector pCAMBIA1301-bar was used
      for transformation. The two-stage selection was carried out using 4 and 250 mg
      l(-1) BASTA((R)) to completely eliminate the chimeric and non-transformed plants.
      The transgene integration into plant genome was evaluated by GUS histochemical
      assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Southern blot hybridization. Among
      the various combinations and concentrations analyzed, highest transformation
      efficiency was obtained when the 2-day pre-cultured explants were subjected to
      sonication for 6 min and vacuum infiltrated for 3 min in Agrobacterium
      suspension, and co-cultivated on MS medium supplemented with 150 microM
      acetosyringone for 3 days. The fidelity of the standardized in planta
      transformation method was assessed in five peanut cultivars and all the cultivars
      responded positively with a transformation efficiency ranging from minimum 31.3% 
      (with cv. CO6) to maximum 38.6% (with cv. TMV7). The in planta transformation
      method optimized in this study could be beneficial to develop superior peanut
      cultivars with desirable genetic traits.

TI  - Small Noncoding RNAs in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 195-213
LID - 10.1007/82_2018_84 [doi]
AB  - During the last decade, small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as essential
      post-transcriptional regulators in bacteria. Nearly all important physiological
      and stress responses are modulated by ncRNA regulators, such as riboswitches,
      trans-acting small RNAs (sRNAs), and cis-antisense RNAs. Recently, three RNA-seq 
      studies identified a total of 1534 candidate ncRNAs from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, a pathogen and biotechnology tool for plants. Only a few ncRNAs have
      been functionally characterized in A. tumefaciens, and some of them appear to be 
      involved in virulence. AbcR1 regulates multiple ABC transporters and modulates
      uptake of a quorum-sensing inhibitor produced by plants. RNA1111, a Ti
      plasmid-encoded sRNA, might regulate the dispersal of the Ti plasmid and
      virulence. In addition, a chromosomally encoded sRNA Atr35C is induced by the vir
      gene regulator VirG and its expression is affected by iron, manganese, and
      hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a possible role in oxidative stress responses and
      Agrobacterium-plant interactions. Progress in ncRNA functional analysis is slow, 
      likely resulting from innate challenges, such as poor sequence conservation and
      imperfect base-pairing between sRNAs and mRNAs, which make computational target
      predictions inefficient. Advances in single-cell-based RNA-seq and proteomics
      approaches would provide valuable tools to reveal regulatory networks involving
      ncRNA regulators.

TI  - The LsrB Protein Is Required for Agrobacterium tumefaciens Interaction with Host 
      Plants.
PG  - 951-961
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-02-18-0041-R [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects and causes crown galls in dicot plants by
      transferring T-DNA from the Ti plasmid to the host plant via a type IV secretion 
      system. This process requires appropriate environmental conditions, certain plant
      secretions, and bacterial regulators. In our previous work, a member of the LysR 
      family of transcriptional regulators (LsrB) in Sinorhizobium meliloti was found
      to modulate its symbiotic interactions with the host plant alfalfa. However, the 
      function of its homolog in A. tumefaciens remains unclear. In this study, we show
      that the LsrB protein of A. tumefaciens is required for efficient transformation 
      of host plants. A lsrB deletion mutant of A. tumefaciens exhibits a number of
      defects, including in succinoglycan production, attachment, and resistance to
      oxidative stress and iron limitation. RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that 465 
      genes were significantly differentially expressed (upregulation of 162 genes and 
      downregulation of 303 genes) in the mutant, compared with the wild-type strain,
      including those involved in succinoglycan production, iron transporter, and
      detoxification enzymes for oxidative stress. Moreover, expression of the lsrB
      gene from S. meliloti, Brucella abortus, or A. tumefaciens rescued the defects
      observed in the S. meliloti or A. tumefaciens lsrB deletion mutant. Our findings 
      suggest that a conserved mechanism of LsrB function exists in symbiotic and
      pathogenic bacteria of the family Rhizobiaceae.

TI  - A simplified and efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens electroporation method.
PG  - 148
LID - 10.1007/s13205-018-1171-9 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a widely used microbial tool in plant molecular
      biology to transfer DNA into plant cells and produce, e.g., stable or transient
      transformants or induce gene silencing. In our study, we present a simplified
      version of electrocompetent cell preparation that is not only time and cost
      efficient, but it requires minimal handling of bacterial cells. Liquid cultures
      are normally used to prepare competent Agrobacterium cells. To overcome the
      difficulties of working with liquid cultures, we propose suspending bacterial
      cells directly from overnight agar plate cultures. In addition, we optimized
      several parameters to simplify the procedure and maximize the number of
      transformants (e.g., Agrobacterium strains, number of washing steps, amount of
      required plasmid DNA, electroporation parameters, type of incubation media, or
      incubation time). This optimized, simple, and fast protocol has proved to be
      efficient enough to obtain transformed colonies with low amounts (as little as 1 
      ng) of plasmid DNA. In addition, it also enabled us to introduce ligated plasmids
      directly into Agrobacterium omitting the E. coli transformation step and
      accelerating the cloning procedure further.

AB  - Introduction: Several platforms including mammalian, plant and insect cells as
      well as bacteria, yeasts, and microalgae are available for the production of
      recombinant proteins. Low efficiency of delivery systems, extracellular and
      intracellular degradation of foreign genes during transformation, difficulties in
      targeting and importing into the nucleus, and finally problems in integration
      into nuclear genome are the most bottlenecks of classical plasmids for producing 
      recombinant proteins. Owing to high growth rate, no common pathogen with humans, 
      being utilized as humans' food, and capability to perform N-glycosylation,
      microalgae are proposed as an ideal system for such biotechnological approaches. 
      Here, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is introduced as an alternative tool for
      transformation of the microalga Dunaliella pseudosalina. Methods: The
      transformation of gfp gene into the D. pseudosalina was evaluated by three
      strains including EHA101, GV3301 and GV3850 of A. tumefaciens. The integrating
      and expression of gfp gene were determined by PCR, RT-PCR, Q-PCR and SDS-PAGE
      analyses. Results: The T-DNA of pCAMBIA1304 plasmid was successfully integrated
      into the genome of the microalgal cells. Although all of the strains were able to
      transform the algal cells, GV3301 possessed higher potential to transform the
      microalgal cells in comparison to EHA101 and GV3850 strains. Moreover, the
      stability of gfp gene was successfully established during a course of two months 
      period in the microalgal genome. Conclusion : Agrobacterium is introduced as a
      competent system for stable transformation of Dunaliella strains in order to
      produce eukaryotic recombinant proteins.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain Chry5 is hypervirulent on many plants including 
      soybean that are poorly transformed by other A. tumefaciens strains. Therefore,
      it is considered as a preferred vector for genetic transformation of plants. Here
      we report the complete nucleotide sequence of its chrysopine-type Ti-plasmid
      pTiChry5. It is comprised of 197,268bp with an overall GC content of 54.5%. Two
      T-DNA regions are present and 219 putative protein-coding sequences could be
      identified in pTiChry5. Roughly one half of the plasmid is highly similar to the 
      agropine-type Ti plasmid pTiBo542, including the virulence genes with an
      identical virG gene, which is responsible for the supervirulence caused by
      pTiBo542. The remaining part of pTiChry5 is less related to that of pTiBo542 and 
      embraces the trb operon of conjugation genes, genes involved in the catabolism of
      Amadori opines and the gene for chrysopine synthase, which replaces the gene for 
      agropine synthase in pTiBo542. With the exception of an insertion of IS869, these
      Ti plasmids differ completely in the set of transposable elements present,
      reflecting a different evolutionary history from a common ancestor.

AB  - The mesophilic fungus Eupenicillium parvum 4-14 is an important producer of
      thermotolerant hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzymes. The aim of this study
      was to establish a method for genetic manipulation of the fungus by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. The promotor PgpdA of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
      gene was isolated from E. parvum 4-14. To transform the fungus, an expression
      plasmid containing a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) gene under the
      control of PgpdA promotor was constructed using the plasmid pAg1-H3 as a parental
      plasmid. Using the fungal ascospores as receptor and hygromycin B resistance as a
      selection marker, the recombinant plasmid was successfully introduced into the
      fungal cells by A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) method.
      Acetosyringone (AS) was essential to the successful transformation. The
      transformation frequency was significantly affected by the co-culture temperature
      and time, the quantity of fungal spores and the AS concentration. The highest
      transformation frequency was up to 373 transformants per 10(5) fungal spores,
      which was higher than those of other fungal species. The fungal transformants
      were genetically stable after five subcultures in the absence of antibiotic. GFP 
      protein was strongly expressed in the hypha of fungal transformants. In
      conclusion, the ATMT is a highly efficient method for genetic manipulation of E. 
      parvum 4-14, and will improve the molecular researches on the fungus.

TI  - An efficient gene disruption method using a positive-negative split-selection
      marker and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation for Nomuraea rileyi.

LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2409-8 [doi]
AB  - Targeted gene disruption via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      (ATMT) and homologous recombination is the most common method used to identify
      and investigate the functions of genes in fungi. However, the gene disruption
      efficiency of this method is low due to ectopic integration. In this study, a
      high-efficiency gene disruption strategy based on ATMT and the split-marker
      method was developed for use in Nomuraea rileyi. The beta-glucuronidase (gus)
      gene was used as a negative selection marker to facilitate the screening of
      putative transformants. We assessed the efficacy of this gene disruption method
      using the NrCat1, NrCat4, and NrPex16 genes and found that the targeting
      efficiency was between 36.2 and 60.7%, whereas the targeting efficiency using
      linear cassettes was only 1.0-4.2%. The efficiency of negative selection assays
      was between 64.1 and 82.3%. Randomly selected deletion mutants exhibited a single
      copy of the hph cassette. Therefore, high-throughput gene disruption could be
      possible using the split-marker method and the majority of ectopic integration
      transformants can be eliminated using negative selection markers. This study
      provides a platform to study the function of genes in N. rileyi.

AB  - A heterotrophic arsenite [As(III)]-oxidizing bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens 
      GW4 isolated from As(III)-rich groundwater sediment showed high As(III)
      resistance and could oxidize As(III) to As(V). The As(III) oxidation could
      generate energy and enhance growth, and AioR was the regulator for As(III)
      oxidase. To determine the related metabolic pathways mediated by As(III)
      oxidation and whether AioR regulated other cellular responses to As(III),
      isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was performed in
      four treatments, GW4 (+AsIII)/GW4 (-AsIII), GW4-DeltaaioR (+AsIII)/GW4-DeltaaioR 
      (-AsIII), GW4-DeltaaioR (-AsIII)/GW4 (-AsIII) and GW4-DeltaaioR (+AsIII)/GW4
      (+AsIII). A total of 41, 71, 82 and 168 differentially expressed proteins were
      identified, respectively. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and
      qRT-PCR, 12 genes/operons were found to interact with AioR. These results
      indicate that As(III) oxidation alters several cellular processes related to
      arsenite, such as As resistance (ars operon), phosphate (Pi) metabolism (pst/pho 
      system), TCA cycle, cell wall/membrane, amino acid metabolism and
      motility/chemotaxis. In the wild type with As(III), TCA cycle flow is perturbed, 
      and As(III) oxidation and fermentation are the main energy resources. However,
      when strain GW4-DeltaaioR lost the ability of As(III) oxidation, the TCA cycle is
      the main way to generate energy. A regulatory cellular network controlled by AioR
      is constructed and shows that AioR is the main regulator for As(III) oxidation,
      besides, several other functions related to As(III) are regulated by AioR in
      parallel.

TI  - Structural basis for high specificity of octopine binding in the plant pathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 18033
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-18243-8 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium pathogens of octopine- and nopaline-types force host plants to
      produce either octopine or nopaline compounds, which they use as nutrients. Two
      Agrobacterium ABC-transporters and their cognate periplasmic binding proteins
      (PBPs) OccJ and NocT import octopine and nopaline/octopine, respectively. Here,
      we show that both octopine transport and degradation confer a selective advantage
      to octopine-type A. tumefaciens when it colonizes plants. We report the X-ray
      structures of the unliganded PBP OccJ and its complex with octopine as well as a 
      structural comparison with NocT and the related PBP LAO from Salmonella enterica,
      which binds amino acids (lysine, arginine and ornithine). We investigated the
      specificity of OccJ, NocT and LAO using several ligands such as amino acids,
      octopine, nopaline and octopine analogues. OccJ displays a high selectivity and
      nanomolar range affinity for octopine. Altogether, the structural and affinity
      data allowed to define an octopine binding signature in PBPs and to construct a
      OccJ mutant impaired in octopine binding, a selective octopine-binding NocT and a
      non-selective octopine-binding LAO by changing one single residue in these PBPs. 
      We proposed the PBP OccJ as a major trait in the ecological specialization of
      octopine-type Agrobacterium pathogens when they colonize and exploit the plant
      host.

TI  - Green route to synthesis of valuable chemical 6-hydroxynicotine from nicotine in 
      tobacco wastes using genetically engineered Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
PG  - 288
LID - 10.1186/s13068-017-0976-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco is widely planted as an important nonfood economic crop
      throughout the world, and large amounts of tobacco wastes are generated during
      the tobacco manufacturing process. Tobacco and its wastes contain high nicotine
      content. This issue has become a major concern for health and environments due to
      its toxicity and complex physiological effects. The microbial transformation of
      nicotine into valuable functionalized pyridine compounds is a promising way to
      utilize tobacco and its wastes as a potential biomass resource. Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens S33 is able to degrade nicotine via a novel hybrid of the pyridine
      and pyrrolidine pathways, in which several intermediates, such as
      6-hydroxynicotine, can be used as renewable precursors to synthesize drugs and
      insecticides. This provides an opportunity to produce valuable chemical
      6-hydroxynicotine from nicotine via biocatalysis using strain S33. RESULTS: To
      accumulate the intermediate 6-hydroxynicotine, we firstly identified the key
      enzyme decomposing 6-hydroxynicotine, named 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase, and then
      disrupted its encoding gene in A. tumefaciens S33. With the whole cells of the
      mutant as a biocatalyst, we tested the possibility to produce 6-hydroxynicotine
      from the nicotine of tobacco and its wastes and optimized the reaction
      conditions. At 30 degrees C and pH 7.0, nicotine could be efficiently transformed
      into 6-hydroxynicotine by the whole cells cultivated with
      glucose/ammonium/6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine medium. The molar conversion and
      the specific catalytic rate reached approximately 98% and 1.01 g
      6-hydroxynicotine h(-1) g(-1) dry cells, respectively. The product could be
      purified easily by dichloromethane extraction with a recovery of 76.8%, and was
      further confirmed by UV spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and NMR analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a novel biocatalytic route to
      6-hydroxynicotine from nicotine by blocking the nicotine catabolic pathway via
      gene disruption, which provides an alternative green strategy to utilize tobacco 
      and its wastes as a biomass resource by converting nicotine into valuable
      hydroxylated-pyridine compounds.

TI  - Two Agrobacterium tumefaciens CheW Proteins Are Incorporated into One
      Chemosensory Pathway with Different Efficiencies.
PG  - 460-470
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-10-17-0255-R [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the agent that causes crown gall tumor disease on
      more than 140 species of dicotyledonous plants. Chemotaxis of A. tumefaciens
      toward the wound sites of the host plant is the first step to recognize the host.
      CheW is a coupling protein that bridges the histidine kinase CheA and the
      chemoreceptors to form the chemotaxis core signaling complex and plays a crucial 
      role in the assembly and function of the large chemosensory array. Unlike all
      previously reported chemotaxis systems, A. tumefaciens has only one major che
      operon but two cheW homologs (atu2075 as cheW1 and atu2617 as cheW2) on unlinked 
      loci. The in-frame deletion of either cheW gene significantly affects A.
      tumefaciens chemotaxis but does not abolish the chemotaxis, unless both cheW
      genes were deleted. The effect of cheW2 deletion on the chemotaxis is more severe
      than that of cheW1 deletion. Either CheW can interact with CheA and couple it to 
      the cell poles. The promoter activity of cheW2 is always higher than that of
      cheW1 under all of the tested conditions. When two cheW genes were adjusted to
      the same expression level by using the identical promoter, the difference between
      the effects of two CheW proteins on the chemotaxis still existed. Therefore, we
      envision that both the different molecular ratio of two CheW proteins in cell and
      the different affinities of two CheW proteins with CheA and chemoreceptors result
      in the efficiency difference of two CheW proteins in functioning in the large
      chemosensory array.

TI  - A highly efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for
      the postharvest pathogen Penicillium digitatum using DsRed and GFP to visualize
      citrus host colonization.

AB  - Penicillium digitatum is a major postharvest pathogen of citrus crops. This
      fungus broadly spreads worldwide and causes green mold disease, which results in 
      severe losses for citrus production. Understanding of the citrus infection by P. 
      digitatum may help develop effective strategies for controlling this pathogen. In
      this study, we have characterized a virulent strain of P. digitatum isolated in
      Vietnam and established a highly efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) system for this fungal strain with two newly constructed
      binary vectors. These binary vectors harbor dominant selectable markers for
      hygromycin or nourseothricin resistance, and expression cassettes for the red
      fluorescent protein (DsRed) or the green fluorescent protein (GFP), respectively.
      Using the established ATMT system, the transformation efficiency of the
      Vietnamese strain could reach a very high yield of 1240+/-165 transformants per
      10(6) spores. Interestingly, we found that GFP is much better than DsRed for in
      situ visualization of citrus fruit colonization by the fungus. Additionally, we
      showed that the transformation system can also be used to generate T-DNA
      insertion mutants for screening non-pathogenic or less virulent strains. Our work
      provides a new platform including a virulent tropical strain of P. digitatum, an 
      optimized ATMT method and two newly constructed binary vectors for investigation 
      of the postharvest pathogen. This platform will help develop strategies to
      dissect molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in more detail as well
      as to identify potential genes of pathogenicity by either insertional mutagenesis
      or gene disruption in this important pathogenic fungus.

TI  - Loss of PopZ At activity in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by Deletion or Depletion
      Leads to Multiple Growth Poles, Minicells, and Growth Defects.
LID - e01881-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01881-17 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens grows by addition of peptidoglycan (PG) at one pole of 
      the bacterium. During the cell cycle, the cell needs to maintain two different
      developmental programs, one at the growth pole and another at the inert old pole.
      Proteins involved in this process are not yet well characterized. To further
      characterize the role of pole-organizing protein A. tumefaciens PopZ (PopZ At ), 
      we created deletions of the five PopZ At domains and assayed their localization. 
      In addition, we created a popZAt deletion strain (DeltapopZAt ) that exhibited
      growth and cell division defects with ectopic growth poles and minicells, but the
      strain is unstable. To overcome the genetic instability, we created an inducible 
      PopZ At strain by replacing the native ribosome binding site with a riboswitch.
      Cultivated in a medium without the inducer theophylline, the cells look like
      DeltapopZAt cells, with a branching and minicell phenotype. Adding theophylline
      restores the wild-type (WT) cell shape. Localization experiments in the depleted 
      strain showed that the domain enriched in proline, aspartate, and glutamate
      likely functions in growth pole targeting. Helical domains H3 and H4 together
      also mediate polar localization, but only in the presence of the WT protein,
      suggesting that the H3 and H4 domains multimerize with WT PopZ At , to stabilize 
      growth pole accumulation of PopZ AtIMPORTANCEAgrobacterium tumefaciens is a
      rod-shaped bacterium that grows by addition of PG at only one pole. The factors
      involved in maintaining cell asymmetry during the cell cycle with an inert old
      pole and a growing new pole are not well understood. Here we investigate the role
      of PopZ At , a homologue of Caulobacter crescentus PopZ (PopZ Cc ), a protein
      essential in many aspects of pole identity in C. crescentus We report that the
      loss of PopZ At leads to the appearance of branching cells, minicells, and
      overall growth defects. As many plant and animal pathogens also employ polar
      growth, understanding this process in A. tumefaciens may lead to the development 
      of new strategies to prevent the proliferation of these pathogens. In addition,
      studies of A. tumefaciens will provide new insights into the evolution of the
      genetic networks that regulate bacterial polar growth and cell division.

AB  - The present investigation deals with the role of calcium-depositing bacterial
      community on corrosion of various engineering metals, namely, brass alloy (BS),
      copper (Cu), stainless steel (SS) and mild steel (MS). Based on the corrosion
      behavior, Agrobacterium tumefaciens EN13, an aerobic bacterium is identified as
      calcium-depositing bacteria on engineering metals. The results of the study are
      supported with biochemical characterization, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, calcium
      quantification, weight loss, electrochemical (impedance and polarization) and
      surface analysis (XRD and FTIR) studies. The calcium quantification study showed 
      carbonate precipitation in abiotic system/biotic system as 50 and 700 ppm,
      respectively. FTIR results too confirmed the accumulation of calcium deposits
      from the environment on the metal surface by EN13. Electrochemical studies too
      supported the corrosion mechanism by showing a significant increase in the charge
      transfer resistance (Rct) of abiotic system (44, 33.6, 45, 29.6 Omega cm(2)) than
      compared to biotic system (41, 10.1 29 and 25 Omega cm(2)). Hence, the outcome of
      the present study confirmed the enhanced bioaccumulation behavior of calcium by
      the strain, EN13.

TI  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens CheY-like protein ClaR regulates biofilm formation.
PG  - 1680-1691
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.000558 [doi]
AB  - The switch from a motile, planktonic existence to an attached biofilm is a major 
      bacterial lifestyle transition that is often mediated by complex regulatory
      pathways. In this report, we describe a CheY-like protein required for control of
      the motile-to-sessile switch in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
      This regulator, which we have designated ClaR, possesses two distinct CheY-like
      receiver (REC) domains and is involved in the negative regulation of biofilm
      formation, through production of the unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) adhesin and
      cellulose. The ClaR REC domains share predicted structural homology with
      characterized REC domains and contain the majority of active site residues known 
      to be essential for protein phosphorylation. REC1 is missing the conserved
      aspartate (N72) residue and although present in REC 2 (D193), it is not required 
      for ClaR-dependent regulation suggesting that phosphorylation, which modulates
      the activity of many CheY-like proteins, appears not to be essential for ClaR
      activity. We also show that ClaR-dependent negative regulation of attachment is
      diminished significantly in mutants for PruA and PruR, proteins known to be
      involved in a pterin-mediated attachment regulation pathway. In A. tumefaciens,
      pterins are required for control of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate
      monophosphate through the DcpA regulator, but our findings suggest that
      pterin-dependent ClaR control of attachment can function independently from DcpA,
      including dampening of c-di-GMP levels. This report of a novel CheY-type biofilm 
      regulator in A. tumefaciens thus also adds significant details to the role of
      pterin-mediated signalling.

AB  - Isolated Agrobacterium tumefaciens was exposed to different extremely low
      frequencies of square amplitude modulated waves (QAMW) from two generators to
      determine the resonance frequency that causes growth inhibition. The carrier was 
      10 MHz sine wave with amplitude +/-10 Vpp which was modulated by a second wave
      generator with a modulation depth of +/- 2Vpp and constant field strength of 200 
      V/m at 28 degrees C. The exposure of A. tumefaciens to 1.0 Hz QAMW for 90 min
      inhibited the bacterial growth by 49.2%. In addition, the tested antibiotics
      became more effective against A. tumefaciens after the exposure. Furthermore,
      results of DNA, dielectric relaxation and TEM showed highly significant molecular
      and morphological changes due to the exposure to 1.0 Hz QAMW for 90 min. An
      in-vivo study has been carried out on healthy tomato plants to test the
      pathogenicity of A. tumefaciens before and after the exposure to QAMW at the
      inhibiting frequency. Symptoms of crown gall and all pathological symptoms were
      more aggressive in tomato plants treated with non-exposed bacteria, comparing
      with those treated with exposed bacteria. We concluded that, the exposure of A.
      tumefaciens to 1.0 Hz QAMW for 90 min modified its cellular activity and DNA
      structure, which inhibited the growth and affected the microbe pathogenicity.

TI  - Expression of a Peptidoglycan Hydrolase from Lytic Bacteriophages Atu_ph02 and
      Atu_ph03 Triggers Lysis of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e01498-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01498-17 [doi]
AB  - To provide food security, innovative approaches to preventing plant disease are
      currently being explored. Here, we demonstrate that lytic bacteriophages and
      phage lysis proteins are effective at triggering lysis of the phytopathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens Phages Atu_ph02 and Atu_ph03 were isolated from
      wastewater and induced lysis of C58-derived strains of A. tumefaciens The
      coinoculation of A. tumefaciens with phages on potato discs limited tumor
      formation. The genomes of Atu_ph02 and Atu_ph03 are nearly identical and are
      approximately 42% identical to those of T7 supercluster phages. In silico
      attempts to find a canonical lysis cassette were unsuccessful; however, we found 
      a putative phage peptidoglycan hydrolase (PPH), which contains a C-terminal
      transmembrane domain. Remarkably, the endogenous expression of pph in the absence
      of additional phage genes causes a block in cell division and subsequent lysis of
      A. tumefaciens cells. When the presumed active site of the N-acetylmuramidase
      domain carries an inactivating mutation, PPH expression causes extensive cell
      branching due to a block in cell division but does not trigger rapid cell lysis. 
      In contrast, the mutation of positively charged residues at the extreme C
      terminus of PPH causes more rapid cell lysis. Together, these results suggest
      that PPH causes a block in cell division and triggers cell lysis through two
      distinct activities. Finally, the potent killing activity of this single lysis
      protein can be modulated, suggesting that it could be engineered to be an
      effective enzybiotic.IMPORTANCE The characterization of bacteriophages such as
      Atu_ph02 and Atu_ph03, which infect plant pathogens such as Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, may be the basis of new biocontrol strategies. First, cocktails of
      diverse bacteriophages could be used as a preventative measure to limit plant
      diseases caused by bacteria; a bacterial pathogen is unlikely to simultaneously
      develop resistances to multiple bacteriophage species. The specificity of
      bacteriophage treatment for the host is an asset in complex communities, such as 
      in orchards where it would be detrimental to harm the symbiotic bacteria in the
      environment. Second, bacteriophages are potential sources of enzymes that
      efficiently lyse bacterial cells. These phage proteins may have a broad
      specificity, but since proteins do not replicate as phages do, their effect is
      highly localized, providing an alternative to traditional antibiotic treatments. 
      Thus, studies of lytic bacteriophages that infect A. tumefaciens may provide
      insights for designing preventative strategies against bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation: an efficient tool for targeted
      gene disruption in Talaromyces marneffei.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1007/s11274-017-2352-0 [doi]
AB  - Talaromyces marneffei causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised
      hosts. An efficient tool for genetic manipulation of T. marneffei will allow for 
      increased understanding of this thermally dimorphic fungus. Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was optimized for targeted gene
      disruption in T. marneffei using the plasmid pDHt/acuD::pyrG. Molecular analyses 
      of transformants were performed by PCR, Southern blot and semi-quantitative
      RT-PCR. A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 was more efficient at transformation than
      strain AGL-1 in ATMT via solid co-cultivation. An A. tumefaciens:T. marneffei
      ratio of 1000:1 in an ATMT liquid co-cultivation led to a relatively high
      transformation efficiency of 90 transformants per 10(6) yeast cells. Using
      ATMT-mediated knockout mutagenesis, we successfully deleted the acuD gene in T.
      marneffei. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed that acuD was disrupted and
      that the foreign pyrG gene was integrated into T. marneffei. Semi-quantitative
      RT-PCR analysis further confirmed that pyrG was expressed normally. These results
      suggest that ATMT can be a potential platform for targeted gene disruption in T. 
      marneffei and that liquid co-cultivation may provide new opportunities to develop
      clinical treatments.

LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnx158 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the causal agent of crown gall disease and is a
      vector for DNA transfer in transgenic plants. The transformation process by A.
      tumefaciens has been widely studied, but the attachment stage has not been well
      characterized. Most measurements of attachment have used microscopy and colony
      counting, both of which are labor and time intensive. To reduce the time and
      effort required to analyze bacteria attaching to plant tissues, we developed a
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify attached A. tumefaciens using
      the chvE gene as marker for the presence of the bacteria. The qPCR detection
      threshold of A. tumefaciens from pure culture was 104 cell equivalents/ml. The A.
      tumefaciens minimum threshold concentration from root-bound populations was
      determined to be 105 cell equivalents/ml inoculum to detect attachment above
      background. The qPCR assay can be used for measuring A. tumefaciens attachment in
      applications such as testing the effects of mutations on bacterial adhesion
      molecules or biofilm formation, comparing attachment across various plant species
      and ecotypes, and detecting mutations in putative attachment receptors expressed 
      in plant roots.

TI  - Virulence protein VirD5 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens binds to kinetochores in
      host cells via an interaction with Spt4.
PG  - 10238-10243
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1706166114 [doi]
AB  - The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall tumor formation in
      plants. During infection the bacteria translocate an oncogenic piece of DNA
      (transferred DNA, T-DNA) into plant cells at the infection site. A number of
      virulence proteins are cotransported into host cells concomitantly with the T-DNA
      to effectuate transformation. Using yeast as a model host, we find that one of
      these proteins, VirD5, localizes to the centromeres/kinetochores in the nucleus
      of the host cells by its interaction with the conserved protein Spt4. VirD5
      promotes chromosomal instability as seen by the high-frequency loss of a
      minichromosome in yeast. By using both yeast and plant cells with a chromosome
      that was specifically marked by a lacO repeat, chromosome segregation errors and 
      the appearance of aneuploid cells due to the presence of VirD5 could be
      visualized in vivo. Thus, VirD5 is a prokaryotic virulence protein that
      interferes with mitosis.

TI  - Understanding the role of residues around the active site tunnel towards
      generating a glucose-tolerant beta-glucosidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A.
PG  - 523-530
LID - 10.1093/protein/gzx039 [doi]
AB  - Most beta-glucosidases are subjected to inhibition by the final hydrolysis
      product glucose resulting in the accumulation of cellobiose and oligosaccharides.
      This accumulated cellobiose and oligosaccharides further inhibit the activities
      of endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolases, resulting in the inhibition of cellulose
      degradation and a more expensive biofuel. To elucidate the mechanism(s) of
      glucose tolerance, we designed and characterised six mutations of a moderately
      glucose-tolerant beta-glucosidase (H0HC94) from the mesophilic bacterium
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. The hydrophobicity and steric were varied across
      non-conserved residues in specific regions of the active site tunnel. In contrast
      to the uncompetitive inhibition of WT enzyme by glucose, C174V and H229S are
      competitively inhibited pointing towards a possible glucose-binding site in the
      protein at these positions. Increasing hydrophobicity at the +1 subsite and
      increasing hydrophobicity and steric at +2 subsites seemed to be critical for
      glucose tolerance for this BG. Additionally, in L178E, specific activity was 1.8 
      times higher on the natural substrate cellobiose while both W127F and L178E
      mutants showed an enhancement in thermostability. The kinetic stability of W127F,
      V176A, L178A and L178E also increased between 2- and 3-folds compared to WT. Our 
      results indicate that while the structure between subsites +1 and +2 is critical 
      for the glucose tolerance, the specific residues may not be identical across such
      enzymes.

TI  - Improved Genetic Transformation of Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) Embryogenic Callus 
      Mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 221-239
LID - 10.1002/cppb.20055 [doi]
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a monocotyledonous semi-perennial C4 grass of the
      Poaceae family. Its capacity to accumulate high content of sucrose and biomass
      makes it one of the most important crops for sugar and biofuel production.
      Conventional methods of sugarcane breeding have shown several limitations due to 
      its complex polyploid and aneuploid genome. However, improvement by
      biotechnological engineering is currently the most promising alternative to
      introduce economically important traits. In this work, we present an improved
      protocol for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of commercial
      sugarcane hybrids using immature top stalk-derived embryogenic callus cultures.
      The callus cultures are transformed with preconditioned A. tumefaciens carrying a
      binary vector that encodes expression cassettes for a gene of interest and the
      bialaphos resistance gene (bar confers resistance to glufosinate-ammonium
      herbicide). This protocol has been used to successfully transform a commercial
      sugarcane cultivar, SP80-3280, highlighting: (i) reduced recalcitrance and
      oxidation; (ii) high yield of embryogenic callus; (iii) improved selection; and
      (iv) shoot regeneration and rooting of the transformed plants. Altogether, these 
      improvements generated a transformation efficiency of 2.2%. This protocol
      provides a reliable tool for a routine procedure for sugarcane improvement by
      genetic engineering. (c) 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Efficacy of Eucalyptus cinerea as a Source of Bioactive Compounds for Curative
      Biocontrol of Crown Gall Caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens Strain B6.
PG  - 9308063
LID - 10.1155/2017/9308063 [doi]
AB  - This research investigated the Eucalyptus cinerea leaves efficiency in the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens biocontrol, the causative agent of crown gall. GC-MS
      analysis of the essential oil (EO) showed that the main components were
      1,8-cineole (61%) and camphene (15.13%). Thanks to its polyphenols, flavonoids,
      quinones, terpenoids, alkaloids, and tannins richness, the EtOAc-F exhibited the 
      most potent antibacterial activity in vitro. Indeed, compared to the other
      fractions, it has the lowest MIC and MBC values of 0.312 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL,
      respectively. The GC-MS analysis of EtOAc-F confirmed its richness in
      antibacterial compounds including gallic acid (7.18%), shikimic acid (5.07%), and
      catechin (3.12%). The time-kill curve assay of EtOAc-F (2.5 mg/mL) showed a
      potent bactericidal effect after 20 min of direct contact with A. tumefaciens. In
      planta experiments, gall weights were significantly reduced when EtOAc-F was
      applied at 0.625 and 2.5 mg/wounds. Besides, the disease reduction rates in gall 
      weight were 95% and 97.5%, respectively. Interestingly, no phytotoxic effect was 
      observed since tomato seeds germinated in the presence of the different
      concentrations of EtOAc-F. These results suggest that EtOAc-F has a good
      potential to be a curative biocontrol agent for crown gall disease.

TI  - Identification of a dimeric KDG aldolase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 2058-2065
LID - 10.1002/prot.25359 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a Gram-negative bacterium and causative agent of
      Crown Gall disease that infects a variety of economically important plants. The
      annotated A. tumefaciens genome contains 10 putative dapA genes, which code for
      dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS). However, we have recently demonstrated that
      only one of these genes (dapA7) encodes a functional DHDPS. The function of the
      other nine putative dapA genes is yet to be determined. Here, we demonstrate
      using bioinformatics that the product of the dapA5 gene (DapA5) possesses all the
      catalytic residues canonical to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) aldolase, which is 
      a class I aldolase involved in glucose metabolism. We therefore expressed,
      purified, and characterized recombinant DapA5 using mass spectrometry, circular
      dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and enzyme kinetics. The 
      results show that DapA5 (1) adopts an alpha/beta structure consistent with the
      TIM-barrel fold of KDG aldolases, (2) possesses KDG aldolase enzyme activity, and
      (3) exists as a tight dimer in solution. This study shows for the first time that
      dapA5 from A. tumefaciens encodes a functional dimeric KDG aldolase.

TI  - Generation and Screening of T-DNA Insertion Mutants Mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens in the Garden Asparagus Stem Blight Pathogen Phomopsis asparagi.
PG  - 1270-1277
LID - 10.1007/s00284-017-1312-0 [doi]
AB  - The garden asparagus stem blight caused by filamentous fungus Phomopsis asparagi 
      exposes a serious threat on asparagus production globally. However, to present,
      we understand poorly about the molecular mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity. To
      facilitate functional genomics research of P. asparagi, here we developed a
      highly efficient and stable Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      approach which yielded 150-200 transformants per 1 x 10(6) conidia. Our results
      indicated that 25 degrees C, acetosyringone concentration of 150 mumol/L, and 72 
      h were recommended as optimal co-cultivation conditions for the transformation.
      Using this transformation approach, we constructed a T-DNA insertion mutant
      library containing 1253 strains. Twenty randomly selected T-DNA insertion mutants
      were able to grow on 0.2 x PDA selective media after five successive subcultures 
      without selective pressure, indicating that the exogenous T-DNA was stably
      integrated into the P. asparagi genome. We confirmed several randomly selected
      mutants using PCR with primers specific to the hph gene. Southern blots suggested
      that three out of the five selected mutants have a single T-DNA insertion.
      Interestingly, multiple mutant candidates with growth defects were obtained from 
      the growth assay. Moreover, several mutants were selected for further analysis on
      the T-DNA flanking sequences through TAIL-PCR analysis. A sequence comparison of 
      total junction fragments implied that the insertion of T-DNA within P. asparagi
      genome appeared to be a random event. The transformation technology and genetic
      resources developed here will facilitate studies of pathogenic mechanisms in this
      devastating filamentous fungal pathogen of garden asparagus.

TI  - Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 reveal the
      molecular mechanism of a novel hybrid nicotine-degrading pathway.
PG  - 4813

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 is able to degrade nicotine via a novel hybrid of
      the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways. It can be utilized to remove nicotine from
      tobacco wastes and transform nicotine into important functionalized pyridine
      precursors for some valuable drugs and insecticides. However, the molecular
      mechanism of the hybrid pathway is still not completely clear. Here we report the
      genome analysis of strain S33 and its transcriptomes grown in glucose-ammonium
      medium and nicotine medium. The complete gene cluster involved in nicotine
      catabolism was found to be located on a genomic island composed of genes
      functionally similar but not in sequences to those of the pyridine and
      pyrrolidine pathways, as well as genes encoding plasmid partitioning and
      replication initiation proteins, conjugal transfer proteins and transposases.
      This suggests that the evolution of this hybrid pathway is not a simple fusion of
      the genes involved in the two pathways, but the result of a complicated lateral
      gene transfer. In addition, other genes potentially involved in the hybrid
      pathway could include those responsible for substrate sensing and transport,
      transcription regulation and electron transfer during nicotine degradation. This 
      study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of the novel hybrid
      pathway for nicotine degradation.

TI  - Relationship between expression level of hygromycin B-resistant gene and
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation efficiency in Beauveria
      bassiana JEF-007.
PG  - 724-731
LID - 10.1111/jam.13529 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AtMT) is an effective
      method for generation of entomopathogenic Beauveria bassiana transformants.
      However, some strains grow on the selective medium containing hygromycin B
      (HygB), which reduces the selection efficiency of the putative transformants. In 
      this work, a relationship between HygB resistance gene promoter and AtMT
      efficiency was investigated to improve the transformant selection. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Ten B. bassiana isolates were grown on 800 mug ml(-1) HygB medium, but
      only JEF-006, -007 and -013 showed susceptibility to the antibiotics.
      Particularly, JEF-007 showed the most dose-dependent susceptibility. Two
      different Ti-Plasmids, pCeg (gpdA promoter based) and pCambia-egfp (CaMV 35S
      promoter based), were constructed to evaluate the promoters on the expression of 
      HygB resistance gene (hph) at 100, 150 and 200 mug ml(-1) HygB medium. Eight days
      after the transformation, wild type, AtMT/pCeg and AtMT/pCambia-egfp colonies
      were observed on 100 mug ml(-1) HygB, but significantly larger numbers of
      colonies were counted on AtMT/pCeg plates. At higher HygB concentration (150 mug 
      ml(-1) ), only AtMT/pCeg colonies were further observed, but very few colonies
      were observed on the wild type and AtMT/pCambia-egfp plates. Putative
      transformants were subjected to PCR, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR to investigate the T-DNA 
      insertion rate and gene expression level. Consequently, >80% of colonies showed
      successful AtMT transformation, and the hph expression level in AtMT/pCeg
      colonies was higher than that of AtMT/pCambia-egfp colonies. CONCLUSIONS: In the 
      HygB-susceptible B. bassianaJEF-007, gpdA promoter works better than CaMV 35S
      promoter in the expression of HygB resistance gene at 150 mug ml(-1) HygB,
      consequently improving the selection efficiency of putative transformants.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results provide useful information
      for determining AtMT effectiveness in B. bassiana isolates, particularly
      antibiotic susceptibility and the role of promoters.

      species.
PG  - 6099-6110

AB  - Interest in using renewable sources of carbon, especially lignocellulosic
      biomass, for the production of hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals has fueled
      interest in exploring various organisms capable of producing hydrocarbon biofuels
      and chemicals or their precursors. The oleaginous (oil-producing) yeast Lipomyces
      starkeyi is the subject of active research regarding the production of
      triacylglycerides as hydrocarbon fuel precursors using a variety of carbohydrate 
      and nutrient sources. The genome of L. starkeyi has been published, which opens
      the door to production strain improvements through the development and use of the
      tools of synthetic biology for this oleaginous species. The first step in
      establishment of synthetic biology tools for an organism is the development of
      effective and reliable transformation methods with suitable selectable marker
      genes and demonstration of the utility of the genetic elements needed for
      expression of introduced genes or deletion of endogenous genes. Chemical-based
      methods of transformation have been published but suffer from low efficiency. To 
      address these problems, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was investigated as
      an alternative method for L. starkeyi and other Lipomyces species. In this study,
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was demonstrated to be effective in the
      transformation of both L. starkeyi and other Lipomyces species. The deletion of
      the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 10 gene was also demonstrated in L. starkeyi.
      In addition to the bacterial antibiotic selection marker gene hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase, the bacterial beta-glucuronidase reporter gene under the
      control of L. starkeyi translation elongation factor 1alpha promoter was also
      stably expressed in six different Lipomyces species. The results from this study 
      demonstrate that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a reliable and
      effective genetic tool for homologous recombination and expression of
      heterologous genes in L. starkeyi and other Lipomyces species.

TI  - Polar Organizing Protein PopZ Is Required for Chromosome Segregation in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e00111-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00111-17 [doi]
AB  - Despite being perceived as relatively simple organisms, many bacteria exhibit an 
      impressive degree of subcellular organization. In Caulobacter crescentus, the
      evolutionarily conserved polar organizing protein PopZ facilitates cytoplasmic
      organization by recruiting chromosome centromeres and regulatory proteins to the 
      cell poles. Here, we characterize the localization and function of PopZ in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a genetically related species with distinct anatomy.
      In this species, we find that PopZ molecules are relocated from the old pole to
      the new pole in the minutes following cell division. PopZ is not required for the
      localization of the histidine kinases DivJ and PdhS1, which become localized to
      the old pole after PopZ relocation is complete. The histidine kinase PdhS2 is
      temporally and spatially related to PopZ in that it localizes to transitional
      poles just before they begin to shed PopZ and disappears from the old pole after 
      PopZ relocalization. At the new pole, PopZ is required for tethering the
      centromere of at least one of multiple replicons (chromosome I), and the loss of 
      popZ results in a severe chromosome segregation defect, aberrant cell division,
      and cell mortality. After cell division, the daughter that inherits polar PopZ is
      shorter in length and delayed in chromosome I segregation compared to its
      sibling. In this cell type, PopZ completes polar relocation well before the onset
      of chromosome segregation. While A. tumefaciens PopZ resembles its C. crescentus 
      homolog in chromosome tethering activity, other aspects of its localization and
      function indicate distinct properties related to differences in cell
      organization.IMPORTANCE Members of the Alphaproteobacteria exhibit a wide range
      of phenotypic diversity despite sharing many conserved genes. In recent years,
      the extent to which this diversity is reflected at the level of subcellular
      organization has become increasingly apparent. However, which factors control
      such organization and how they have changed to suit different body plans are
      poorly understood. This study focuses on PopZ, which is essential for many
      aspects of polar organization in Caulobacter crescentus, but its role in other
      species is unclear. We explore the similarities and differences in PopZ functions
      between Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Caulobacter crescentus and conclude that
      PopZ lies at a point of diversification in the mechanisms that control
      cytoplasmic organization and cell cycle regulation in Alphaproteobacteria.

TI  - Absence of the Polar Organizing Protein PopZ Results in Reduced and Asymmetric
      Cell Division in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
LID - e00101-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/JB.00101-17 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a rod-shaped bacterium that grows by polar insertion
      of new peptidoglycan during cell elongation. As the cell cycle progresses,
      peptidoglycan synthesis at the pole ceases prior to insertion of new
      peptidoglycan at midcell to enable cell division. The A. tumefaciens homolog of
      the Caulobacter crescentus polar organelle development protein PopZ has been
      identified as a growth pole marker and a candidate polar growth-promoting factor.
      Here, we characterize the function of PopZ in cell growth and division of A.
      tumefaciens Consistent with previous observations, we observe that PopZ localizes
      specifically to the growth pole in wild-type cells. Despite the striking
      localization pattern of PopZ, we find the absence of the protein does not impair 
      polar elongation or cause major changes in the peptidoglycan composition.
      Instead, we observe an atypical cell length distribution, including minicells,
      elongated cells, and cells with ectopic poles. Most minicells lack DNA,
      suggesting a defect in chromosome segregation. Furthermore, the canonical cell
      division proteins FtsZ and FtsA are misplaced, leading to asymmetric sites of
      cell constriction. Together, these data suggest that PopZ plays an important role
      in the regulation of chromosome segregation and cell division.IMPORTANCEA.
      tumefaciens is a bacterial plant pathogen and a natural genetic engineer.
      However, very little is known about the spatial and temporal regulation of cell
      wall biogenesis that leads to polar growth in this bacterium. Understanding the
      molecular basis of A. tumefaciens growth may allow for the development of
      innovations to prevent disease or to promote growth during biotechnology
      applications. Finally, since many closely related plant and animal pathogens
      exhibit polar growth, discoveries in A. tumefaciens may be broadly applicable for
      devising antimicrobial strategies.

TI  - Periplasmic Nicotine Dehydrogenase NdhAB Utilizes Pseudoazurin as Its
      Physiological Electron Acceptor in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
LID - e01050-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01050-17 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 can grow with nicotine as the sole source of
      carbon, nitrogen, and energy via a novel hybrid of the pyridine pathway and the
      pyrrolidine pathway. Characterization of the enzymes involved in the hybrid
      pathway is important for understanding its biochemical mechanism. Here, we report
      that the molybdenum-containing nicotine dehydrogenase (NdhAB), which catalyzes
      the initial step of nicotine degradation, is located in the periplasm of strain
      S33, while the 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase and 6-hydroxypseudooxynicoine oxidase
      are in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the fact that NdhA has a Tat signal
      peptide. Interestingly, an open reading frame (ORF) adjacent to the ndhAB gene
      was verified to encode a copper-containing electron carrier, pseudoazurin (Paz), 
      which has a signal peptide typical of bacterial Paz proteins. Both were
      transported into the periplasm after being produced in the cytoplasm. We purified
      NdhAB from the periplasmic fraction of strain S33 and found that with Paz as the 
      physiological electron acceptor, NdhAB catalyzed the hydroxylation of nicotine at
      a specific rate of 110.52 +/- 8.09 mumol . min(-1) . mg of protein(-1), where the
      oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group of the product 6-hydroxynicotine was derived
      from H2O. The apparent Km values for nicotine and Paz were 1.64 +/- 0.07 muM and 
      3.61 +/- 0.23 muM, respectively. NAD(P)(+), O2, and ferredoxin could not serve as
      electron acceptors. Disruption of the paz gene disabled the strain for nicotine
      degradation, indicating that Paz is required for nicotine catabolism in the
      strain. These findings help our understanding of electron transfer during
      nicotine degradation in bacteria.IMPORTANCE Nicotine is a toxic and addictive
      N-heterocyclic aromatic alkaloid produced in tobacco. Its catabolism in organisms
      and degradation in tobacco wastes have become major concerns for human health and
      the environment. Bacteria usually decompose nicotine using the classical strategy
      of hydroxylating the pyridine ring with the help of activated oxygen by nicotine 
      dehydrogenase, which binds one molybdopterin, two [2Fe2S] clusters, and usually
      one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as well. However, the physiological
      electron acceptor for the reaction is still unknown. In this study, we found that
      the two-component nicotine dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33,
      naturally lacking an FAD-binding domain, is located in the periplasmic space and 
      uses a copper-containing electron carrier, pseudoazurin, as its physiological
      electron acceptor. We report here the role of pseudoazurin in a reaction
      catalyzed by a molybdopterin-containing hydroxylase occurring in the periplasmic 
      space. These results provide new biochemical knowledge on microbial degradation
      of N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Pseudocercospora fijiensis
      to Determine the Role of PfHog1 in Osmotic Stress Regulation and Virulence
      Modulation.
PG  - 830
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.00830 [doi]
AB  - Black Sigatoka disease, caused by Pseudocercospora fijiensis is a serious
      constraint to banana production worldwide. The disease continues to spread in new
      ecological niches and there is an urgent need to develop strategies for its
      control. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      is well known to respond to changes in external osmolarity. HOG pathway
      activation leads to phosphorylation, activation and nuclear transduction of the
      HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The activated HOG1 triggers
      several responses to osmotic stress, including up or down regulation of different
      genes, regulation of protein translation, adjustments to cell cycle progression
      and synthesis of osmolyte glycerol. This study investigated the role of the
      MAPK-encoding PfHog1 gene on osmotic stress adaptation and virulence of P.
      fijiensis. RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of PfHog1 significantly
      suppressed growth of P. fijiensis on potato dextrose agar media supplemented with
      1 M NaCl, indicating that PfHog1 regulates osmotic stress. In addition, virulence
      of the PfHog1-silenced mutants of P. fijiensis on banana was significantly
      reduced, as observed from the low rates of necrosis and disease development on
      the infected leaves. Staining with lacto phenol cotton blue further confirmed the
      impaired mycelial growth of the PfHog1 in the infected leaf tissues, which was
      further confirmed with quantification of the fungal biomass using absolute-
      quantitative PCR. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PfHog1 plays a
      critical role in osmotic stress regulation and virulence of P. fijiensis on its
      host banana. Thus, PfHog1 could be an interesting target for the control of black
      Sigatoka disease in banana.

AB  - A chemically defined media was developed for growing Agrobacterium tumefaciens at
      large scale for commercial production of recombinant proteins by transient
      expression in plants. Design of experiments was used to identify major and
      secondary effects of ten media components: sucrose, ammonium sulfate ((NH4 )2 SO4
      ), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4 *7H2 O), calcium chloride dihydrate
      (CaCl2 *2H2 O), iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4 *7H2 O), manganese (II)
      sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4 *H2 O), zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4 *7H2 O),
      sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and a sodium/potassium phosphate
      buffer (Na2 HPO4 /KH2 PO4 ). Calcium and zinc were found to have no detectable
      impact on biomass concentration or transient expression level, and concentrations
      of the other components that maximized final biomass concentration were
      determined. The maximum specific growth rate of Agrobacterium strain C58C1 pTFS40
      in this media was 0.33 +/- 0.01 h(-1) and the final biomass concentration after
      26 h of batch growth in shake flasks was 2.6 g dry cell weight/L. Transient
      expression levels of the reporter protein GUS following infiltration of a
      recombinant Agrobacterium strain C58C1 into N. benthamiana were comparable when
      the strain was grown in the defined media, Lysogeny Broth (LB) media, or yeast
      extract-peptone (YEP) media. In LB and YEP media, free amino acid concentration
      was measured at three points over the course of batch growth of Agrobacterium
      strain C58C1 pTFS40; results indicated that l-serine and l-asparagine were
      depleted from the media first, followed by l-alanine and l-glutamic acid. (c)

TI  - Thermostabilization of the uronate dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      by semi-rational design.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s13568-017-0405-2 [doi]
AB  - Aldaric acids represent biobased 'top value-added chemicals' that have the
      potential to substitute petroleum-derived chemicals. Until today they are mostly 
      produced from corresponding aldoses using strong chemical oxidizing agents. An
      environmentally friendly and more selective process could be achieved by using
      natural resources such as seaweed or pectin as raw material. These contain large 
      amounts of uronic acids as major constituents such as glucuronic acid and
      galacturonic acid which can be converted into the corresponding aldaric acids via
      an enzyme-based oxidation using uronate dehydrogenase (Udh). The Udh from
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens (UdhAt) features the highest catalytic efficiency of
      all characterized Udhs using glucuronic acid as substrate (829 s(-1) mM(-1)).
      Unfortunately, it suffers from poor thermostability. To overcome this limitation,
      we created more thermostable variants using semi-rational design. The amino acids
      for substitution were chosen according to the B factor in combination with four
      additional knowledge-based criteria. The triple variant A41P/H101Y/H236K showed
      higher kinetic and thermodynamic stability with a T 50(15) value of 62.2 degrees 
      C (3.2 degrees C improvement) and a GU of 2.3 kJ/mol compared to wild type.
      Interestingly, it was only obtained when including a neutral mutation in the
      combination.

TI  - A new and efficient approach for construction of uridine/uracil auxotrophic
      mutants in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 107

AB  - Aspergillus oryzae is a filamentous fungus widely used in food industry and as a 
      microbial cell factory for recombinant protein production. Due to the inherent
      resistance of A. oryzae to common antifungal compounds, genetic transformation of
      this mold usually requires auxotrophic mutants. In this study, we show that
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) method is very efficient
      for deletion of the pyrG gene in different Aspergillus oryzae wild-type strains
      to generate uridine/uracil auxotrophic mutants. Our data indicated that all the
      obtained uridine/uracil auxotrophic transformants, which are 5- fluoroorotic acid
      (5-FOA) resistant, exist as the pyrG deletion mutants. Using these auxotrophic
      mutants and the pyrG selectable marker for genetic transformation via A.
      tumefaciens, we could get about 1060 transformants per 10(6) fungal spores. In
      addition, these A. oryzae mutants were also used successfully for expression of
      the DsRed fluorescent reporter gene under control of the A. oryzae amyB promoter 
      by the ATMT method, which resulted in obvious red transformants on agar plates.
      Our work provides a new and effective approach for constructing the
      uridine/uracil auxotrophic mutants in the importantly industrial fungus A.
      oryzae. This strategy appears to be applicable to other filamentous fungi to
      develop similar genetic transformation systems based on auxotrophic/nutritional
      markers for food-grade recombinant applications.

TI  - The Abundance of Endofungal Bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter (syn. Agrobacterium

      Tripartite Sebacinalean Symbiosis with Higher Plants.
PG  - 629

AB  - Rhizobium radiobacter (syn. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, syn. "Agrobacterium
      fabrum") is an endofungal bacterium of the fungal mutualist Piriformospora (syn. 
      Serendipita) indica (Basidiomycota), which together form a tripartite
      Sebacinalean symbiosis with a broad range of plants. R. radiobacter strain F4
      (RrF4), isolated from P. indica DSM 11827, induces growth promotion and systemic 
      resistance in cereal crops, including barley and wheat, suggesting that R.
      radiobacter contributes to a successful symbiosis. Here, we studied the impact of
      endobacteria on the morphology and the beneficial activity of P. indica during
      interactions with plants. Low numbers of endobacteria were detected in the
      axenically grown P. indica (long term lab-cultured, lcPiri) whereas mycelia
      colonizing the plant root contained increased numbers of bacteria. Higher numbers
      of endobacteria were also found in axenic cultures of P. indica that was freshly 
      re-isolated (riPiri) from plant roots, though numbers dropped during repeated
      axenic re-cultivation. Prolonged treatments of P. indica cultures with various
      antibiotics could not completely eliminate the bacterium, though the number of
      detectable endobacteria decreased significantly, resulting in partial-cured P.
      indica (pcPiri). pcPiri showed reduced growth in axenic cultures and poor
      sporulation. Consistent with this, pcPiri also showed reduced plant growth
      promotion and reduced systemic resistance against powdery mildew infection as
      compared with riPiri and lcPiri. These results are consistent with the assumption
      that the endobacterium R. radiobacter improves P. indica's fitness and thus
      contributes to the success of the tripartite Sebacinalean symbiosis.

TI  - Silencing of Agrobacterium tumefaciens oncogenes ipt and iaaM induces resistance 
      to crown gall disease in plum but not in apricot.
PG  - 2163-2173
LID - 10.1002/ps.4600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, two vectors with short-length chimeric transgenes were
      used to produce Prunus rootstocks resistant to crown gall disease through
      RNA-interference-mediated gene silencing of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      oncogenes ipt and iaaM. RESULTS: Transgenic plum and apricot lines were produced 
      with efficiencies of up to 7.7 and 1.1% respectively. An in vitro evaluation
      method allowed identification of susceptible lines and reduction in the number of
      lines to be evaluated in the greenhouse. Five transgenic plum lines, expressing
      transgene-derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) and low levels of transgene
      hairpin RNA (hpRNA), showed a significant reduction in the development of the
      disease after infection with Agrobacterium strains C58 and A281 under greenhouse 
      conditions. However, unexpectedly, all transgenic apricot lines were gall
      susceptible. The infection of apricot plants with a binary vector containing only
      the 6b oncogene demonstrated that the expression of this gene is involved in the 
      induction of tumours in the apricot species. CONCLUSION: RNAi-mediated gene
      silencing can be used for inducing crown gall resistance in plum rootstocks.
      These could be used to graft non-genetically modified commercial fruit cultivars 
      reducing, or eliminating, the disease symptoms. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical

TI  - Characterization the carotenoid productions and profiles of three Rhodosporidium 
      toruloides mutants from Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 335-342
LID - 10.1002/yea.3236 [doi]
AB  - The red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a known lipid producer capable of
      accumulating large amounts of triacylglycerols and carotenoids. However, it
      remains challenging to study its carotenoid production profiles owing to limited 
      biochemical information and inefficient genetic tools. Here we used an
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) to change its carotenoid
      production and profiles. We constructed R. toruloides NP11 mutant libraries with 
      ATMT, selected three mutants with different colours, characterized their
      carotenoid products by high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-MS) analysis and assured differences among those strains in terms of
      carotenoid production and its composition profiles. We then located T-DNA
      insertion sites using the genome walking technology and provided discussions in
      terms of the new phenotypes. This study is the first of its kind to change the
      carotenoid production profiles in R. toruloides. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley &

AB  - VirE2 is a ssDNA binding protein essential for virulence in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. A tetracysteine mutant (VirE2-TC) was prepared for in vitro and in
      vivo fluorescence imaging based on the ReAsH reagent. VirE2-TC was found to be
      biochemically active as it binds both ssDNA and the acidic secretion chaperone
      VirE1. It was also biologically functional in complementing virE2 null strains
      transforming Arabidopsis thaliana roots and Nicotiana tabacum leaves. In vitro
      experiments demonstrated a two-color fluorescent complex using VirE2-TC/ReAsH and
      Alexa Fluor 488 labeled ssDNA. In vivo, fluorescent VirE2-TC/ReAsH was detected
      in bacteria and in plant cells at time frames relevant to transformation.

PG  - e0174759
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0174759 [doi]
AB  - NAD+ has emerged as a crucial element in both bioenergetic and signaling pathways
      since it acts as a key regulator of cellular and organismal homeostasis. Among
      the enzymes involved in its recycling, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)
      deamidase is one of the key players in the bacterial pyridine nucleotide cycle,
      where it catalyzes the conversion of NMN into nicotinic acid mononucleotide
      (NaMN), which is later converted to NAD+ in the Preiss-Handler pathway. The
      biochemical characteristics of bacterial NMN deamidases have been poorly studied,
      although they have been investigated in some firmicutes, gamma-proteobacteria and
      actinobacteria. In this study, we present the first characterization of an NMN
      deamidase from an alphaproteobacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtCinA). The
      enzyme was active over a broad pH range, with an optimum at pH 7.5. Moreover, the
      enzyme was quite stable at neutral pH, maintaining 55% of its activity after 14
      days. Surprisingly, AtCinA showed the highest optimal (80 degrees C) and melting 
      (85 degrees C) temperatures described for an NMN deamidase. The above described
      characteristics, together with its high catalytic efficiency, make AtCinA a
      promising biocatalyst for the production of pure NaMN. In addition, six mutants
      (C32A, S48A, Y58F, Y58A, T105A and R145A) were designed to study their
      involvement in substrate binding, and two (S31A and K63A) to determine their
      contribution to the catalysis. However, only four mutants (C32A, S48A Y58F and
      T105A) showed activity, although with reduced catalytic efficiency. These
      results, combined with a thermal and structural analysis, reinforce the Ser/Lys
      catalytic dyad mechanism as the most plausible among those proposed.

AB  - Production of recombinant proteins in plants through Agrobacterium-mediated
      transient expression is a promising method of producing human therapeutic
      proteins, vaccines, and commercial enzymes. This process has been shown to be
      viable at a large scale and involves growing large quantities of wild-type plants
      and infiltrating the leaf tissue with a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      bearing the genes of interest. This study examined one of the steps in this
      process that had not yet been optimized: the scale-up of Agrobacterium production
      to sufficient volumes for large-scale plant infiltration. Production of
      Agrobacterium strain C58C1 pTFS40 was scaled up from shake flasks (50-100 mL) to 
      benchtop (5 L) scale with three types of media: Lysogeny broth (LB), yeast
      extract peptone (YEP) media, and a sucrose-based defined media. The maximum
      specific growth rate (mu max) of the strain in the three types of media was 0.46 
      +/- 0.04 h(-1) in LB media, 0.43 +/- 0.03 h(-1) in YEP media, and 0.27 +/- 0.01
      h(-1) in defined media. The maximum biomass concentration reached at this scale
      was 2.0 +/- 0.1, 2.8 +/- 0.1, and 2.6 +/- 0.1 g dry cell weight (DCW)/L for the
      three media types. Production was successfully scaled up to a 100-L working
      volume reactor with YEP media, using k L a as the scale-up parameter.

TI  - Is there any crosstalk between the chemotaxis and virulence induction signaling
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens?

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil-born phytopathogenic bacterium, is well known
      as a nature's engineer due to its ability to genetically transform the host by
      transferring a DNA fragment (called T-DNA) from its Ti plasmid to host-cell
      genome. To combat the harsh soil environment and seek the appropriate host, A.
      tumefaciens can sense and be attracted by a large number of chemical compounds
      released by wounded host. As a member of alpha-proteobacterium, A. tumefaciens
      has a chemotaxis system different from that found in Escherichia coli, since many
      chemoattractants for A. tumefaciens chemotaxis are virulence (vir) inducers.
      However, advances in the study of the chemotaxis paradigm, E. coli chemotaxis
      system, have provided enough information to analyze the A. tumefaciens
      chemotaxis. At low concentration, chemoattractants elicit A. tumefaciens
      chemotaxis and attract the species to the wound sites of the host. At high
      concentration, chemoattractants induce the expression of virulence genes and
      trigger T-DNA transfer. Recent studies on the VirA and ChvE of the vir-induction 
      system provide some evidences to support the crosstalk between chemotaxis and
      vir-induction. This review compares the core components of chemotaxis signaling
      system of A. tumefaciens with those observed in other species, discusses the
      connection between chemotaxis and vir-induction in A. tumefaciens, and proposes a
      model depicting the signaling crosstalk between chemotaxis and vir-induction.

      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens GW4.
PG  - 43252
LID - 10.1038/srep43252 [doi]
AB  - Some arsenite [As(III)]-oxidizing bacteria exhibit positive chemotaxis towards
      As(III), however, the related As(III) chemoreceptor and regulatory mechanism
      remain unknown. The As(III)-oxidizing bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens GW4
      displays positive chemotaxis towards 0.5-2 mM As(III). Genomic analyses revealed 
      a putative chemoreceptor-encoding gene, mcp, located in the arsenic gene island
      and having a predicted promoter binding site for the As(III) oxidation regulator 
      AioR. Expression of mcp and other chemotaxis related genes (cheA, cheY2 and fliG)
      was inducible by As(III), but not in the aioR mutant. Using capillary assays and 
      intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra analysis, Mcp was confirmed to be
      responsible for chemotaxis towards As(III) and to bind As(III) (but not As(V) nor
      phosphate) as part of the sensing mechanism. A bacterial one-hybrid system
      technique and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that AioR interacts
      with the mcp regulatory region in vivo and in vitro, and the precise AioR binding
      site was confirmed using DNase I foot-printing. Taken together, these results
      indicate that this Mcp is responsible for the chemotactic response towards
      As(III) and is regulated by AioR. Additionally, disrupting the mcp gene affected 
      bacterial As(III) oxidation and growth, inferring that Mcp may exert some sort of
      functional connection between As(III) oxidation and As(III) chemotaxis.

LID - 10.1038/srep43225 [doi]
AB  - Antimonite [Sb(III)]-oxidizing bacteria can transform the toxic Sb(III) into the 
      less toxic antimonate [Sb(V)]. Recently, the cytoplasmic Sb(III)-oxidase AnoA and
      the periplasmic arsenite [As(III)] oxidase AioAB were shown to responsible for
      bacterial Sb(III) oxidation, however, disruption of each gene only partially
      decreased Sb(III) oxidation efficiency. This study showed that in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens GW4, Sb(III) induced cellular H2O2 content and H2O2 degradation gene 
      katA. Gene knock-out/complementation of katA, anoA, aioA and anoA/aioA and
      Sb(III) oxidation and growth experiments showed that katA, anoA and aioA were
      essential for Sb(III) oxidation and resistance and katA was also essential for
      H2O2 resistance. Furthermore, linear correlations were observed between cellular 
      H2O2 and Sb(V) content in vivo and chemical H2O2 and Sb(V) content in vitro (R(2)
      = 0.93 and 0.94, respectively). These results indicate that besides the biotic
      factors, the cellular H2O2 induced by Sb(III) also catalyzes bacterial Sb(III)
      oxidation as an abiotic oxidant. The data reveal a novel mechanism that bacterial
      Sb(III) oxidation is associated with abiotic (cellular H2O2) and biotic (AnoA and
      AioAB) factors and Sb(III) oxidation process consumes cellular H2O2 which
      contributes to microbial detoxification of both Sb(III) and cellular H2O2.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0172823 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens GW4 is a heterotrophic arsenite [As(III)]/antimonite
      [Sb(III)]-oxidizing strain. The As(III) oxidase AioAB is responsible for As(III) 
      oxidation in the periplasm and it is also involved in Sb(III) oxidation in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. In addition, Sb(III) oxidase AnoA and cellular H2O2
      are also responsible for Sb(III) oxidation in strain GW4. However, the deletion
      of aioA increased the Sb(III) oxidation efficiency in strain GW4. In the present 
      study, we found that the cell mobility to Sb(III), ATP and NADH contents and heat
      release were also increased by Sb(III) and more significantly in the aioA mutant.
      Proteomics and transcriptional analyses showed that proteins/genes involved in
      Sb(III) oxidation and resistance, stress responses, carbon metabolism, cell
      mobility, phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism, and amino acid and nucleotide
      metabolism were induced by Sb(III) and were more significantly induced in the
      aioA mutant. The results suggested that Sb(III) oxidation may produce energy. In 
      addition, without periplasmic AioAB, more Sb(III) would enter bacterial cells,
      however, the cytoplasmic AnoA and the oxidative stress response proteins were
      significantly up-regulated, which may contribute to the increased Sb(III)
      oxidation efficiency. Moreover, the carbon metabolism was also activated to
      generate more energy against Sb(III) stress. The generated energy may be used in 
      Sb transportation, DNA repair, amino acid synthesis, and cell mobility, and may
      be released in the form of heat.

TI  - Animal component-free Agrobacterium tumefaciens cultivation media for better
      GMP-compliance increases biomass yield and pharmaceutical protein expression in
      Nicotiana benthamiana.
LID - 10.1002/biot.201600721 [doi]
AB  - Transient expression systems allow the rapid production of recombinant proteins
      in plants. Such systems can be scaled up to several hundred kilograms of biomass,
      making them suitable for the production of pharmaceutical proteins required at
      short notice, such as emergency vaccines. However, large-scale transient
      expression requires the production of recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      strains with the capacity for efficient gene transfer to plant cells. The complex
      media often used for the cultivation of this species typically include
      animal-derived ingredients that can contain human pathogens, thus conflicting
      with the requirements of good manufacturing practice (GMP). We replaced all the
      animal-derived components in yeast extract broth (YEB) cultivation medium with
      soybean peptone, and then used a design-of-experiments approach to optimize the
      medium composition, increasing the biomass yield while maintaining high levels of
      transient expression in subsequent infiltration experiments. The resulting plant 
      peptone Agrobacterium medium (PAM) achieved a two-fold increase in OD600 compared
      to YEB medium during a 4-L batch fermentation lasting 18 h. Furthermore, the
      yields of the monoclonal antibody 2G12 and the fluorescent protein DsRed were
      maintained when the cells were cultivated in PAM rather than YEB. We have thus
      demonstrated a simple, efficient and scalable method for medium optimization that
      reduces process time and costs. The final optimized medium for the cultivation of
      A. tumefaciens completely lacks animal-derived components, thus facilitating the 
      GMP-compliant large-scale transient expression of recombinant proteins in plants.

TI  - An Agrobacterium tumefaciens Strain with Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Transaminase
      Activity Shows an Enhanced Genetic Transformation Ability in Plants.
PG  - 42649
LID - 10.1038/srep42649 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens has the unique ability to mediate inter-kingdom DNA
      transfer, and for this reason, it has been utilized for plant genetic
      engineering. To increase the transformation frequency in plant genetic
      engineering, we focused on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a negative
      factor in the Agrobacterium-plant interaction. Recent studies have shown
      contradictory results regarding the effects of GABA on vir gene expression,
      leading to the speculation that GABA inhibits T-DNA transfer. In this study, we
      examined the effect of GABA on T-DNA transfer using a tomato line with a low GABA
      content. Compared with the control, the T-DNA transfer frequency was increased in
      the low-GABA tomato line, indicating that GABA inhibits T-DNA transfer.
      Therefore, we bred a new A. tumefaciens strain with GABA transaminase activity
      and the ability to degrade GABA. The A. tumefaciens strain exhibited increased
      T-DNA transfer in two tomato cultivars and Erianthus arundinacues and an
      increased frequency of stable transformation in tomato.

AB  - Tomato black ring virus (TBRV, genus Nepovirus) infects a wide range of
      economically important plants such as tomato, potato, tobacco and cucumber. Here,
      a successful construction of infectious full-length cDNA clones of the TBRV
      genomic RNAs (RNA1 and RNA2) is reported for the first time. The engineered
      constructs consisting of PCR-amplified DNAs were cloned into binary vector pJL89 
      immediately downstream of a double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, 
      and upstream of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and nopaline synthase
      terminator (NOS). The symptoms induced on plants agroinoculated with both
      constructs were indistinguishable from those caused by the wild-type virus. The
      infectivity of obtained clones was verified by reinoculation to Nicotiana tabacum
      cv. Xanthi, Chenopodium quinoa and Cucumis sativus. The presence of viral
      particles and RNA was confirmed by electron microscopy and reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Constructed full-length infectious cDNA 
      clones will serve as an excellent tool to study virus-host-vector interactions.

AB  - Malassezia spp. are part of the normal human and animal mycobiota but are also
      associated with a variety of dermatological diseases. The absence of a
      transformation system hampered studies to reveal mechanisms underlying the switch
      from the non-pathogenic to pathogenic life style. Here we describe, a highly
      efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system for Malassezia
      furfur and M. pachydermatis. A binary T-DNA vector with the hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase (hpt) selection marker and the green fluorescent protein gene 
      (gfp) was introduced in M. furfur and M. pachydermatis by combining the
      transformation protocols of Agaricus bisporus and Cryptococcus neoformans.
      Optimal temperature and co-cultivation time for transformation were 5 and 7days
      at 19 degrees C and 24 degrees C, respectively. Transformation efficiency was
      0.75-1.5% for M. furfur and 0.6-7.5% for M. pachydermatis. Integration of the hpt
      resistance cassette and gfp was verified using PCR and fluorescence microscopy,
      respectively. The T-DNA was mitotically stable in approximately 80% of the
      transformants after 10 times sub-culturing in the absence of hygromycin.
      Improving transformation protocols contribute to study the biology and
      pathophysiology of Malassezia.

AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/D4 type IV secretion system (T4SS) comprises
      12 membrane-bound proteins, and it assembles a surface-exposed T-pilus. It is
      considered to be the archetypical system that is generally used to orient the
      nomenclature of other T4SS. Whereas the sequence similarities between T4SSs from 
      different organisms are often limited, the general mechanism of action appears to
      be conserved, and the evolutionary relationship to bacterial conjugation systems 
      and to T4SSs from animal pathogens is well established. Agrobacterium is a
      natural genetic engineer that is extensively used for the generation of
      transgenic plants for research and for agro-biotechnological applications. It
      also served as an early model for the understanding of pathogen-host interactions
      and for the transfer of macromolecular virulence factors into host cells. The
      knowledge on the mechanism of its T4SS inspired the search for small molecules
      that inhibit the virulence of bacterial pathogens and of bacterial conjugation.
      Inhibitors of bacterial virulence and of conjugation have interesting potential
      as alternatives to antibiotics and as inhibitors of antimicrobial resistance gene
      transfer. Mechanistic work on the Agrobacterium T4SS will continue to inspire the
      search for inhibitor target sites and drug design.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens estC, Encoding an Enzyme Containing Esterase Activity, 
      Is Regulated by EstR, a Regulator in the MarR Family.
PG  - e0168791
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168791 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of the A. tumefaciens genome revealed estC, which encodes an esterase
      located next to its transcriptional regulator estR, a regulator of esterase in
      the MarR family. Inactivation of estC results in a small increase in the
      resistance to organic hydroperoxides, whereas a high level of expression of estC 
      from an expression vector leads to a reduction in the resistance to organic
      hydroperoxides and menadione. The estC gene is transcribed divergently from its
      regulator, estR. Expression analysis showed that only high concentrations of
      cumene hydroperoxide (CHP, 1 mM) induced expression of both genes in an
      EstR-dependent manner. The EstR protein acts as a CHP sensor and a
      transcriptional repressor of both genes. EstR specifically binds to the operator 
      sites OI and OII overlapping the promoter elements of estC and estR. This binding
      is responsible for transcription repression of both genes. Exposure to organic
      hydroperoxide results in oxidation of the sensing cysteine (Cys16) residue of
      EstR, leading to a release of the oxidized repressor from the operator sites,
      thereby allowing transcription and high levels of expression of both genes. The
      estC is the first organic hydroperoxide-inducible esterase-encoding gene in
      alphaproteobacteria.

TI  - Transformation of medicinal plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1220-1228
AB  - For many years attempts are made to develop efficient methods for transformation 
      of medicinal plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is a soil bacteria which
      possess a natural ability to infect plants in places of injures which results in 
      arise of cancerous growths (crown gall). This is possible thanks a transfer of
      fragment of Ti plasmid into plant cells and stable integration with a plant
      genome. Efficiency of medicinal plant transformation depends on many factors for 
      example: Agrobacterium strain, methods and procedures of transformation as well
      as on plant species, type and age of the explants and regeneration conditions.
      The main goal of plant transformation is to increase the amount of naturally
      occurring bioactive compounds and the production of biopharmaceuticals. Genetic
      plant transformation via bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium is a complex process
      which requires detailed analysis of incorporated transgene expression and occurs 
      only in the case when the plant cell acquires the ability to regenerate. In many 
      cases, the regeneration efficiency observed in medicinal plants are inefficient
      after applied transformation procedures. To date there have been attempts of
      genetic transformation by using A. tumefaciens of medicinal plants belonging to
      the families: Apocynaceae, Araceae, Araliaceae, Asphodelaceae, Asteraceae,
      Begoniaceae, Crassulaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Linaceae, Papaveraceae,
      Plantaginaceae, Scrophulariaceae and Solanaceae.

TI  - The use of stable and unstable green fluorescent proteins for studies in two
      bacterial models: Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Xanthomonas campestris pv.
      campestris.
PG  - 581-590
LID - 10.1007/s00203-016-1327-0 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescent proteins have been used to track plant pathogens to understand their 
      host interactions. To be useful, the transgenic pathogens must present similar
      behaviour than the wild-type isolates. Herein, a GFP marker was used to transform
      two plant pathogenic bacteria, Agrobacterium and Xanthomonas, to localize and
      track the bacteria during infection. The transgenic bacteria were evaluated to
      determine whether they showed the same fitness than the wild-type strains or
      whether the expression of the GFP protein interfered in the bacterial activity.
      In Agrobacterium, the plasmid used for transformation was stable in the bacteria 
      and the strain kept the virulence, while Xanthomonas was not able to conserve the
      plasmid and transformed strains showed virulence variations compared to wild-type
      strains. Although marking bacteria with GFP to track infection in plants is a
      common issue, works to validate the transgenic strains and corroborate their
      fitness are not usual. Results, presented here, confirm the importance of proper 
      fitness tests on the marked strains before performing localization assays, to
      avoid underestimation of the microbe population or possible artificial effects in
      its interaction with the plant.

AB  - An efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) approach
      was developed for the plant pathogenic fungus, Cercospora zeae-maydis, which is
      the causative agent of gray leaf spot in maize. The transformation was evaluated 
      with five parameters to test the efficiencies of transformation. Results showed
      that spore germination time, co-cultivation temperature and time were the
      significant influencing factors in all parameters. Randomly selected
      transformants were confirmed and the transformants were found to be mitotically
      stable, with single-copy T-DNA integration in the genome. T-DNA flanking
      sequences were cloned by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. Thus, the ATMT
      approach is an efficient tool for insertional mutagenesis of C. zeae-maydis.

AB  - Wide-spread abundance in soil and water, coupled with high toxicity have put
      arsenic at the top of the list of environmental contaminants. Early studies
      demonstrated that both concentration and the valence state of inorganic arsenic
      (arsenite, As(III) vs. arsenate As(V)) can be modulated by microbes. Using
      genetics, transcriptomic and proteomic techniques, microbe-arsenic
      detoxification, respiratory As(V) reduction and As(III) oxidation have since been
      examined. The effect of arsenic exposure on whole-cell intracellular microbial
      metabolism, however, has not been extensively studied. We combined LC-MS and (1) 
      H NMR to quantify metabolic changes in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain 5A) upon
      exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of As(III). Metabolomics analysis reveals
      global differences in metabolite concentrations between control and As(III)
      exposure groups, with significant perturbations to intermediates shuttling into
      and cycling within the TCA cycle. These data are most consistent with the
      disruption of two key TCA cycle enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase and
      alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Glycolysis also appeared altered following
      As(III) stress, with carbon accumulating as complex saccharides. These
      observations suggest that an important consequence of As(III) contamination in
      nature will be to alter microbial carbon metabolism at the microbial community
      level and thus has the potential to foundationally impact all biogeochemical
      cycles in the environment.

TI  - Transformation of the cucurbit powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera xanthii by
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1961-1973
LID - 10.1111/nph.14297 [doi]
AB  - The obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Podosphaera xanthii is the main causal
      agent of powdery mildew in cucurbit crops all over the world. A major limitation 
      of molecular studies of powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphales) is their genetic
      intractability. In this work, we describe a robust method based on the
      promiscuous transformation ability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens for reliable
      transformation of P. xanthii. The A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT)
      system yielded transformants of P. xanthii with diverse transferred DNA (T-DNA)
      constructs. Analysis of the resultant transformants showed the random integration
      of T-DNA into the P. xanthii genome. The integrations were maintained in
      successive generations in the presence of selection pressure. Transformation was 
      found to be transient, because in the absence of selection agent, the introduced 
      genetic markers were lost due to excision of T-DNA from the genome. The ATMT
      system represents a potent tool for genetic manipulation of P. xanthii and will
      likely be useful for studying other biotrophic fungi. We hope that this method
      will contribute to the development of detailed molecular studies of the intimate 
      interaction established between powdery mildew fungi and their host plants.

TI  - Development of Marker-Free Insect-Resistant Indica Rice by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-Mediated Co-transformation.
PG  - 1608
AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation is an efficient strategy to generate
      marker-free transgenic plants. In this study, the vectors pMF-2A( *) containing a
      synthetic cry2A( *) gene driven by maize ubiquitin promoter and pCAMBIA1301
      harboring hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) were introduced into Minghui86
      (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica), an elite indica restorer line. Two independent
      transformants containing both the cry2A( *) gene and hpt gene were regenerated.
      Several homozygous marker-free transgenic progenies were derived from family
      2AH2, and three of them were selected for further insect bioassay in the
      laboratory and field. Insect-resistance assays revealed that all the three
      transgenic lines were highly resistant to striped stem borer (Chilo
      suppressalis), yellow stem borer (Tryporyza incertulas) and rice leaf folder
      (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis). The measurement of Cry2A protein concentration showed
      that Cry2A protein was stably expressed in leaves and stems of homozygous
      transgenic lines and their hybrids. The yields of the marker-free homozygous
      transgenic lines and their hybrids were not significantly different from those of
      their corresponding controls. Furthermore, the results of flanking sequence
      isolation showed that the T-DNA in line 8-30 was integrated into the intergenic
      region of chromosome 2 (between Os02g43680 and Os02g43690). These results
      indicate that the marker-free transgenic rice has the potential for commercial
      production.

TI  - Biocontrol activity and patulin-removal effects of Bacillus subtilis, Rhodobacter
      sphaeroides and Agrobacterium tumefaciens against Penicillium expansum.
PG  - 1384-1393
LID - 10.1111/jam.13208 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the biocontrol potential of Bacillus
      subtilis CICC 10034, Rhodobacter sphaeroides CGMCC 1.2182 and Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens CGMCC 1.2554 against patulin (PAT)-producer Penicillium expansum and 
      their ability to remove PAT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus subtilis effectively
      inhibited P. expansum both on apples and in in vitro experiments, which reduced
      the rot diameter on apples by 38% compared with the control. The reduction was
      followed by those induced by A. tumefaciens (27.63%) and R. sphaeroides (23.67%).
      None of the cell-free supernatant (CFS) was able to prevent pathogen growth.
      Three antagonists could suppress PAT production by P. expansum on apples by 98.5,
      93.7 and 94.99% after treatment with B. subtilis, R. sphaeroides and A.
      tumefaciens respectively. In addition, the three strains led to a 0.56-1.47 log
      CFU g(-1) reduction in colony number of P. expansum on apples. Survival of
      antagonists on apple wounds revealed their tolerance to PAT. Furthermore, both
      live and autoclaved cells of three strains efficiently adsorbed artificially
      spiked PAT from medium. CONCLUSIONS: The selected antagonists could be applied
      before harvesting to control apple infection by PAT-producing fungi and also
      during processing to act as PAT detoxifiers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE
      STUDY: Since little information related to the capability of R. sphaeroides and
      A. tumefaciens to inhibit P. expansum is currently available, the results of this
      study provide some new perspectives to the biocontrol field.

TI  - Low Agrobacterium tumefaciens inoculum levels and a long co-culture period lead
      to reduced plant defense responses and increase transgenic shoot production of
      sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.).
PG  - 354-366
AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is typically conducted by inoculating
      plant tissues with an Agrobacterium suspension containing approximately
      10(8)-10(9) bacteria mL(-1), followed by a 2-3-d co-culture period. Use of longer
      co-culture periods could potentially increase transformation efficiencies by
      allowing more time for Agrobacterium to interact with plant cells, but bacterial 
      overgrowth is likely to occur, leading to severe tissue browning and reduced
      transformation and regeneration. Low bacterial inoculum levels were therefore
      evaluated as a means to reduce the negative outcomes associated with long
      co-culture. The use of low inoculum bacterial suspensions (approximately 6 x
      10(2) bacteria mL(-1)) followed by long co-culture (15 d) led to the production
      of an average of three transformed sunflower shoots per explant while the use of 
      high inoculum (approximately 6 x 10(8) bacteria mL(-1)) followed by short
      co-culture (3 d) led to no transformed shoots. Low inoculum and long co-culture
      acted synergistically, and both were required for the improvement of sunflower
      transformation. Gene expression analysis via qRT-PCR showed that genes related to
      plant defense response were generally expressed at lower levels in the explants
      treated with low inoculum than those treated with high inoculum during 15 d of
      co-culture, suggesting that low inoculum reduced the induction of plant defense
      responses. The use of low inoculum with long co-culture (LI/LC) led to large
      increases in sunflower transformation efficiency. This method has great potential

AB  - Phyllosticta citricarpa is the epidemiological agent of Citrus Black Spot (CBS)
      disease, which is responsible for large economic losses worldwide. CBS is
      characterized by the presence of spores (pycnidiospores) in dark lesions of
      fruit, which are also responsible for short distance dispersal of the disease.
      The identification of genes involved in asexual reproduction of P. citricarpa can
      be an alternative for directional disease control. We analyzed a library of
      mutants obtained through Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation system, looking
      for alterations in growth and reproductive structure formation. Two mutant
      strains were found to have lost the ability to form pycnidia. The flanking T-DNA 
      insertion regions were identified on P. citricarpa genome by using blast analysis
      and further gene prediction. The predicted genes containing the T-DNA insertions 
      were identified as Spindle Poison Sensitivity Scp3, Ion Transport protein, and
      Cullin Binding proteins. The Ion Transport and Cullin Binding proteins are known 
      to be correlated with sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi; however, the
      exact mechanism by which these proteins act on spore formation in P. citricarpa
      needs to be better characterized. The Scp3 proteins are suggested here for the
      first time as being associated with asexual reproduction in fungus. This protein 
      is associated with microtubule formation, and as microtubules play an essential
      role as spindle machinery for chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, insertions 
      in this gene can lead to abnormal formations, such as that observed here in P.
      citricarpa. We suggest these genes as new targets for fungicide development and
      CBS disease control, by iRNA.

TI  - Identification of Conidiogenesis-Associated Genes in Colletotrichum
      gloeosporioides by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation.
PG  - 802-810
AB  - The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is one of the most significant pathogens
      leading to huge economic losses. To infect plants and cause disease
      dissemination, the fungus elaborates to produce asexual spores called conidia,
      which are long-lived and highly resistant to environmental stresses. Here, we
      report a large-scale, systematic genome-wide screening of
      conidiogenesis-associated genes via conidiation assays, and high-efficiency
      TAIL-PCRs. Of 10,210 independent transformants tested, 59 mutants exhibited
      significant variation in conidial production. The T-DNA right flanking sequences 
      of 11 conidiation-related transformants were further identified, and the obtained
      sequences were aligned to the genome sequence to uncover the novel loci of
      sporogenesis. When considering together, this study provided a large number of
      conidial production-variation mutants and the conidiation-related genes, which
      will be a valuable resource for characterizing the molecular mechanisms of
      conidial formation in the fungus.

TI  - Insertion Mutation in HMG-CoA Lyase Increases the Production Yield of MPA through
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation.
PG  - 1924-1932

AB  - Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an antibiotic produced by Penicillium brevicompactum. 
      MPA has antifungal, antineoplastic, and immunosuppressive functions, among
      others. beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase is a key enzyme in
      the bypass metabolic pathway. The inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA lyase increases 
      the MPA biosynthetic flux by reducing the generation of by-products. In this
      study, we cloned the P. brevicompactum HMG-CoA lyase gene using the thermal
      asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction and gene walking technology.
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was used to insert a
      mutated HMG-CoA lyase gene into P. brevicompactum. Successful insertion of the
      HMG-CoA lyase gene was confirmed by hygromycin screening, PCR, Southern blot
      analysis, and enzyme content assay. The maximum MPA production by transformants
      was 2.94 g/l. This was 71% higher than wild-type ATCC 16024. Our results
      demonstrate that ATMT may be an alternative practical genetic tool for
      directional transformation of P. brevicompactum.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis revealed that a quorum sensing system regulates the
      transfer of the pAt megaplasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 661
LID - 10.1186/s12864-016-3007-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain P4 is atypical, as the strain is not
      pathogenic and produces a for this species unusual quorum sensing signal,
      identified as N-(3-hydroxy-octanoyl)-homoserine lactone (3OH,C8-HSL). RESULTS: By
      sequence analysis and cloning, a functional luxI-like gene, named cinI, has been 
      identified on the At plasmid of A. tumefaciens strain P4. Insertion mutagenesis
      in the cinI gene and transcriptome analyses permitted the identification of 32
      cinI-regulated genes in this strain, most of them encoding proteins responsible
      for the conjugative transfer of pAtP4. Among these genes were the avhB genes that
      encode a type 4 secretion system (T4SS) involved in the formation of the
      conjugation apparatus, the tra genes that encode the DNA transfer and replication
      (Dtr) machinery and cinI and two luxR orthologs. These last two genes, cinR and
      cinX, exhibit an unusual organization, with the cinI gene surrounded by the two
      luxR orthologs. Conjugation experiments confirmed that the conjugative transfer
      of pAtP4 is regulated by 3OH,C8-HSL. Root colonization experiments indicated that
      the quorum sensing regulation of the conjugation of the pAtP4 does not confer a
      gain or a loss of fitness to the bacterial host in the tomato plant rhizosphere. 
      CONCLUSION: This work is the first identification of the occurrence of a quorum
      sensing regulation of the pAt conjugation phenomenon in Agrobacterium.

TI  - Two Distinct Cardiolipin Synthases Operate in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e0160373
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0160373 [doi]
AB  - Cardiolipin (CL) is a universal component of energy generating membranes. In most
      bacteria, it is synthesized via the condensation of two molecules
      phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by phospholipase D-type cardiolipin synthases (PLD-type
      Cls). In the plant pathogen and natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens CL comprises up to 15% of all phospholipids in late stationary growth
      phase. A. tumefaciens harbors two genes, atu1630 (cls1) and atu2486 (cls2),
      coding for PLD-type Cls. Heterologous expression of either cls1 or cls2 in
      Escherichia coli resulted in accumulation of CL supporting involvement of their
      products in CL synthesis. Expression of cls1 and cls2 in A. tumefaciens is
      constitutive and irrespective of the growth phase. Membrane lipid profiling of A.
      tumefaciens mutants suggested that Cls2 is required for CL synthesis at early
      exponential growth whereas both Cls equally contribute to CL production at later

      tumefaciens tolerates large changes in CL content since the CL-deficient
      cls1/cls2 double mutant showed no apparent defects in growth, stress tolerance,
      motility, biofilm formation, UV-stress and tumor formation on plants.

      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

AB  - UNLABELLED: In bacteria, the functions of polyamines, small linear polycations,
      are poorly defined, but these metabolites can influence biofilm formation in
      several systems. Transposon insertions in an ornithine decarboxylase (odc) gene
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, predicted to direct synthesis of the polyamine
      putrescine from ornithine, resulted in elevated cellulose. Null mutants for odc
      grew somewhat slowly in a polyamine-free medium but exhibited increased biofilm
      formation that was dependent on cellulose production. Spermidine is an essential 
      metabolite in A. tumefaciens and is synthesized from putrescine in A. tumefaciens
      via the stepwise actions of carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase (CASDH) and
      carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (CASDC). Exogenous addition of either putrescine 
      or spermidine to the odc mutant returned biofilm formation to wild-type levels.
      Low levels of exogenous spermidine restored growth to CASDH and CASDC mutants,
      facilitating weak biofilm formation, but this was dampened with increasing
      concentrations. Norspermidine rescued growth for the odc, CASDH, and CASDC
      mutants but did not significantly affect their biofilm phenotypes, whereas in the
      wild type, it stimulated biofilm formation and depressed spermidine levels. The
      odc mutant produced elevated levels of cyclic diguanylate monophosphate
      (c-di-GMP), exogenous polyamines modulated these levels, and expression of a
      c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase reversed the enhanced biofilm formation. Prior work
      revealed accumulation of the precursors putrescine and carboxyspermidine in the
      CASDH and CASDC mutants, respectively, but unexpectedly, both mutants accumulated
      homospermidine; here, we show that this requires a homospermidine synthase (hss) 
      homologue. IMPORTANCE: Polyamines are small, positively charged metabolites that 
      are nearly ubiquitous in cellular life. They are often essential in eukaryotes
      and more variably in bacteria. Polyamines have been reported to influence the
      surface-attached biofilm formation of several bacteria. In Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, mutants with diminished levels of the polyamine spermidine are
      stimulated for biofilm formation, and exogenous provision of spermidine decreases
      biofilm formation. Spermidine is also essential for A. tumefaciens growth, but
      the related polyamine norspermidine exogenously rescues growth and does not
      diminish biofilm formation, revealing that the growth requirement and biofilm
      control are separable. Polyamine control of biofilm formation appears to function
      via effects on the cellular second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate,
      regulating the transition from a free-living to a surface-attached lifestyle.

AB  - Heterologous expression has been proven to be a valid strategy for elucidating
      the natural products produced by gene clusters uncovered by genome sequencing
      projects. Efforts have been made to efficiently clone gene clusters directly from
      genomic DNA and several approaches have been developed. Here, we present an
      alternative strategy based on the site-specific recombinase system Cre/loxP for
      direct cloning gene clusters. A type three secretion system (T3SS) gene cluster
      (~32 kb) from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 and DNA fragment (~78 kb) containing 
      the siderophore biosynthetic gene cluster from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 have
      been successfully cloned into pBeloBAC11 with "Cre/loxP plus BAC" strategy. Based
      on the fact that Cre/loxP system has successfully used for genomic engineering in
      a wide range of organisms, we believe that this strategy could be widely used for
      direct cloning of large DNA fragment.

PG  - 28625

AB  - The MinION is a portable single-molecule DNA sequencing instrument that was
      released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in 2014, producing long sequencing reads
      by measuring changes in ionic flow when single-stranded DNA molecules translocate
      through the pores. While MinION long reads have an error rate substantially
      higher than the ones produced by short-read sequencing technologies, they can
      generate de novo assemblies of microbial genomes, after an initial correction
      step that includes alignment of Illumina sequencing data or detection of overlaps
      between Oxford Nanopore reads to improve accuracy. In this study, MinION reads
      were generated from the multi-chromosome genome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      strain LBA4404. Errors in the consensus two-directional (sense and antisense)
      "2D" sequences were first characterized by way of comparison with an internal
      reference assembly. Both Illumina-based correction and self-correction were
      performed and the resulting corrected reads assembled into high-quality hybrid
      and non-hybrid assemblies. Corrected read datasets and assemblies were
      subsequently compared. The results shown here indicate that both hybrid and
      non-hybrid methods can be used to assemble Oxford Nanopore reads into informative
      multi-chromosome assemblies, each with slightly different outcomes in terms of
      contiguity and accuracy.

LID - 10.1128/AEM.01392-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Mechanistic studies of many processes in Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      have been hampered by a lack of genetic tools for characterization of essential
      genes. In this study, we used a Tn7-based method for inducible control of
      transcription from an engineered site on the chromosome. We demonstrate that this
      method enables tighter control of inducible promoters than plasmid-based systems 
      and can be used for depletion studies. The method enables the construction of
      depletion strains to characterize the roles of essential genes in A. tumefaciens 
      Here, we used the strategy to deplete the alphaproteobacterial master regulator
      CtrA and found that depletion of this essential gene results in dramatic rounding
      of cells, which become nonviable. IMPORTANCE: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a
      bacterial plant pathogen and natural genetic engineer. Thus, studies of essential
      processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA replication and segregation,
      cell growth, and division, may provide insights for limiting disease or improving
      biotechnology applications.

AB  - Botryosphaeria dothidea is a severe causal agent of die-back and cankers of many 
      woody plants and causes great losses in many regions. The pathogenic mechanism of
      this pathogen has not been well explored due to lack of mutants and genetic
      information. In this study, we developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) protocol for B. dothidea protoplasts using vector pBHt2
      containing the hph gene as a selection marker under the control of trp C
      promoter. Using this protocol we successfully generated the B. dothidea
      transformants with efficiency about 23 transformants per 10(5) protoplasts. This 
      is the first report of genetic transformation of B. dothidea via ATMT and this
      protocol provides an effective tool for B. dothidea genome manipulation, gene
      identification and functional analysis.

AB  - A new method of transgenic development called "In-planta" transformation method, 
      where Agrobacterium is used to infect the plantlets but the steps of in vitro
      regeneration of plants is totally avoided. In this study, we have reported a
      simple In-planta method for efficient transformation of diploid cotton Gossypium 
      hirsutum cv LRK-516 Anjali using Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA-105 harbouring
      recombinant binary vector plasmid pBinAR with Arabidopsis At-NPR1 gene. Four day 
      old plantlets were used for transformation. A vertical cut was made at the
      junction of cotyledonary leaves, moderately bisecting the shoot tip and exposing 
      meristem cells at apical meristem. This site was infected with Agrobacterium
      inoculum. The transgenic events obtained were tested positive for the presence of
      At-NPR1 gene with promoter nptII gene. They are also tested negative for vector
      backbone integration and Agrobacterium contamination in T0 events. With this
      method a transformation frequency of 6.89% was reported for the cv LRK-516.

TI  - Regulation of the Cobalt/Nickel Efflux Operon dmeRF in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 
      and a Link between the Iron-Sensing Regulator RirA and Cobalt/Nickel Resistance.
PG  - 4732-4742
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01262-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 genome harbors an operon containing
      the dmeR (Atu0890) and dmeF (Atu0891) genes, which encode a transcriptional
      regulatory protein belonging to the RcnR/CsoR family and a metal efflux protein
      belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family, respectively. The
      dmeRF operon is specifically induced by cobalt and nickel, with cobalt being the 
      more potent inducer. Promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusion, an electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay, and DNase I footprinting assays revealed that DmeR
      represses dmeRF transcription through direct binding to the promoter region
      upstream of dmeR A strain lacking dmeF showed increased accumulation of
      intracellular cobalt and nickel and exhibited hypersensitivity to these metals;
      however, this strain displayed full virulence, comparable to that of the
      wild-type strain, when infecting a Nicotiana benthamiana plant model under the
      tested conditions. Cobalt, but not nickel, increased the expression of many
      iron-responsive genes and reduced the induction of the SoxR-regulated gene sodBII
      Furthermore, control of iron homeostasis via RirA is important for the ability of
      A. tumefaciens to cope with cobalt and nickel toxicity. IMPORTANCE: The molecular
      mechanism of the regulation of dmeRF transcription by DmeR was demonstrated. This
      work provides evidence of a direct interaction of apo-DmeR with the corresponding
      DNA operator site in vitro The recognition site for apo-DmeR consists of 10-bp
      AT-rich inverted repeats separated by six C bases
      (5'-ATATAGTATACCCCCCTATAGTATAT-3'). Cobalt and nickel cause DmeR to dissociate
      from the dmeRF promoter, which leads to expression of the metal efflux gene dmeF 
      This work also revealed a connection between iron homeostasis and cobalt/nickel
      resistance in A. tumefaciens.

      strains on Agrobacterium tumefaciens biofilms.
PG  - 586-94
LID - 10.1111/apm.12547 [doi]
AB  - The ability to form biofilms plays an important role in bacteria-host
      interactions, including plant pathogenicity. In this work, we investigated the
      action of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by rhizospheric strains of
      Pseudomonas chlororaphis 449, Pseudomonas fluorescens B-4117, Serratia plymuthica
      IC1270, as well as Serratia proteamaculans strain 94, isolated from spoiled meat,
      on biofilms formation by three strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens which are
      causative agents of crown-gall disease in a wide range of plants. In dual culture
      assays, the pool of volatiles emitted by the tested Pseudomonas and Serratia
      strains suppressed the formation of biofilms of A. tumefaciens strains grown on
      polycarbonate membrane filters and killed Agrobacterium cells in mature biofilms.
      The individual VOCs produced by the tested Pseudomonas strains, that is, ketones 
      (2-nonanone, 2-heptanone, 2-undecanone), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) produced
      by Serratia strains, were shown to kill A. tumefaciens cells in mature biofilms
      and suppress their formation. The data obtained in this study suggest an
      additional potential of some ketones and DMDS as protectors of plants against A. 
      tumefaciens strains, whose virulence is associated with the formation of biofilms
      on the infected plants.

TI  - Molybdate uptake by Agrobacterium tumefaciens correlates with the cellular
      molybdenum cofactor status.
PG  - 809-22
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13421 [doi]
AB  - Many enzymes require the molybdenum cofactor, Moco. Under Mo-limiting conditions,
      the high-affinity ABC transporter ModABC permits molybdate uptake and Moco
      biosynthesis in bacteria. Under Mo-replete conditions, Escherichia coli represses
      modABC transcription by the one-component regulator, ModE, consisting of a
      DNA-binding and a molybdate-sensing domain. Instead of a full-length ModE
      protein, many bacteria have a shorter ModE protein, ModE(S) , consisting of a
      DNA-binding domain only. Here, we asked how such proteins sense the intracellular
      molybdenum status. We show that the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ModE(S) protein
      Atu2564 is essential for modABC repression. ModE(S) binds two Mo-boxes in the
      modA promoter as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Northern
      analysis revealed cotranscription of modE(S) with the upstream gene, atu2565,
      which was dispensable for ModE(S) activity. To identify genes controlling ModE(S)
      function, we performed transposon mutagenesis. Tn5 insertions resulting in
      derepressed modA transcription mapped to the atu2565-modE(S) operon and several
      Moco biosynthesis genes. We conclude that A. tumefaciens ModE(S) activity
      responds to Moco availability rather than to molybdate concentration directly, as
      is the case for E. coli ModE. Similar results in Sinorhizobium meliloti suggest
      that Moco dependence is a common feature of ModE(S) regulators.

AB  - The plasmid vector pGreenII is widely used to produce plant transformants via a
      process that involves propagation in Escherichia coli However, we show here that 
      pGreenII-based constructs can be unstable in E. coli as a consequence of them
      hampering cell division and promoting cell death. In addition, we describe a new 
      version of pGreenII that does not cause these effects, thereby removing the
      selective pressure for mutation, and a new strain of E. coli that better
      tolerates existing pGreenII-based constructs without reducing plasmid yield. The 
      adoption of the new derivative of pGreenII and the E. coli strain, which we have 
      named pViridis and MW906, respectively, should help to ensure the integrity of
      genes destined for study in plants while they are propagated and manipulated in
      E. coli The mechanism by which pGreenII perturbs E. coli growth appears to be
      dysregulation within the ColE1 origin of replication.

TI  - Loss of PodJ in Agrobacterium tumefaciens Leads to Ectopic Polar Growth,
      Branching, and Reduced Cell Division.
PG  - 1883-1891
LID - 10.1128/JB.00198-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium
      that elongates by unipolar addition of new cell envelope material. Approaching
      cell division, the growth pole transitions to a nongrowing old pole, and the
      division site creates new growth poles in sibling cells. The A. tumefaciens
      homolog of the Caulobacter crescentus polar organizing protein PopZ localizes
      specifically to growth poles. In contrast, the A. tumefaciens homolog of the C.
      crescentus polar organelle development protein PodJ localizes to the old pole
      early in the cell cycle and accumulates at the growth pole as the cell cycle
      proceeds. FtsA and FtsZ also localize to the growth pole for most of the cell
      cycle prior to Z-ring formation. To further characterize the function of polar
      localizing proteins, we created a deletion of A. tumefaciens podJ (podJAt).
      DeltapodJAt cells display ectopic growth poles (branching), growth poles that
      fail to transition to an old pole, and elongated cells that fail to divide. In
      DeltapodJAt cells, A. tumefaciens PopZ-green fluorescent protein (PopZAt-GFP)
      persists at nontransitioning growth poles postdivision and also localizes to
      ectopic growth poles, as expected for a growth-pole-specific factor. Even though 
      GFP-PodJAt does not localize to the midcell in the wild type, deletion of podJAt 
      impacts localization, stability, and function of Z-rings as assayed by
      localization of FtsA-GFP and FtsZ-GFP. Z-ring defects are further evidenced by
      minicell production. Together, these data indicate that PodJAt is a critical
      factor for polar growth and that DeltapodJAt cells display a cell division
      phenotype, likely because the growth pole cannot transition to an old pole.
      IMPORTANCE: How rod-shaped prokaryotes develop and maintain shape is complicated 
      by the fact that at least two distinct species-specific growth modes exist:
      uniform sidewall insertion of cell envelope material, characterized in model
      organisms such as Escherichia coli, and unipolar growth, which occurs in several 
      alphaproteobacteria, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens Essential components for
      unipolar growth are largely uncharacterized, and the mechanism constraining
      growth to one pole of a wild-type cell is unknown. Here, we report that the
      deletion of a polar development gene, podJAt, results in cells exhibiting ectopic
      polar growth, including multiple growth poles and aberrant localization of cell
      division and polar growth-associated proteins. These data suggest that PodJAt is 
      a critical factor in normal polar growth and impacts cell division in A.

AB  - Accumulation of amino acids is a common plant response to several biotic and
      abiotic stresses, even if the roles of these accumulations remain often poorly
      understood. In a recent study we measured the levels of different amino acids in 
      tumors of Arabidopsis thaliana induced by the phytopathogen Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens and correlated these data with changes of gene expressions in both
      organisms. This led to the demonstration that the non-protein amino acid GABA
      plays an important role for the adaptation of the bacteria to the plant tumor
      environment, and especially in the control of the virulent Ti plasmid
      dissemination. Here we present a model that describes how different GABA:proline 
      ratios in the A. thaliana host may have different impacts on the conjugation of
      A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid, and advance the view that the amino acid metabolism of
      plant hosts could be critical for the propagation of the virulence genes in A.

AB  - Transient expression of viral proteins in plants is a novel alternative to other 
      expression platforms. The viral proteins can be used as potential vaccines or in 
      diagnostics. Nicotiana benthamiana leaves or whole plants are infiltrated with
      recombinant Agrobacterium that harbor the gene of interest. Protein expression in
      the plants is rapid and results are obtained within 2-7 days. Here we describe
      how to make electrocompetent Agrobacterium, how to transform Agrobacterium, how
      to infiltrate leaves or plants with the recombinant Agrobacterium, and lastly how
      to extract the protein for analysis by gel electrophoresis.

TI  - Artificial Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains exhibit diverse mechanisms to
      repress Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae-induced hypersensitive response and
      non-host resistance in Nicotiana benthamiana.
PG  - 489-502
LID - 10.1111/mpp.12411 [doi]
AB  - Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) rapidly triggers a hypersensitive response
      (HR) and non-host resistance in its non-host plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Here,
      we report that Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 blocks Xoo-induced HR in
      N. benthamiana when pre-infiltrated or co-infiltrated, but not when
      post-infiltrated at 4 h after Xoo inoculation. This suppression by A. tumefaciens
      is local and highly efficient to Xoo. The HR-inhibiting efficiency of A.
      tumefaciens is strain dependent. Strain C58C1 has almost no effect on Xoo-induced
      HR, whereas strains GV3101, EHA105 and LBA4404 nearly completely block HR
      formation. Intriguingly, these three HR-inhibiting strains employ different
      strategies to repress HR. Strain GV3101 displays strong antibiotic activity and
      thus suppresses Xoo growth. Comparison of the genotype and Xoo antibiosis
      activity of wild-type A. tumefaciens strain C58 and a set of C58-derived strains 
      reveals that this Xoo antibiosis activity of A. tumefaciens is negatively, but
      not solely, regulated by the transferred-DNA (T-DNA) of the Ti plasmid pTiC58.
      Unlike GV3101, strains LBA4404 and EHA105 exhibit no significant antibiotic
      effect on Xoo, but rather abolish hydrogen peroxide accumulation. In addition,
      expression assays indicate that strains LBA4404 and EHA105 may inhibit
      Xoo-induced HR by suppression of the expression of Xoo type III secretion system 
      (T3SS) effector genes hpa1 and hrpD6. Collectively, our results unveil the
      multiple levels of effects of A. tumefaciens on Xoo in N. benthamiana and provide
      insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the bacterial antibiosis of A. 
      tumefaciens and the non-host resistance induced by Xoo.

      Survival under Zinc-Limiting Conditions.
PG  - 3503-3514
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00299-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Agrobacterium tumefaciens has a cluster of genes (Atu3178, Atu3179,
      and Atu3180) encoding an ABC-type transporter, here named troA, troB, and troC,
      respectively, which is shown here to be a zinc-specific uptake system. Reverse
      transcription (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed that troA, troB, and troC are
      cotranscribed, with troC as the first gene of the operon. The yciC (Atu3181) gene
      is transcribed in the opposite orientation to that of the troCBA operon and
      belongs to a metal-binding GTPase family. Expression of troCBA and yciC was
      inducible under zinc-limiting conditions and was controlled by the zinc uptake
      regulator, Zur. Compared to the wild type, the mutant strain lacking troC was
      hypersensitive to a metal chelator, EDTA, and the phenotype could be rescued by
      the addition of zinc, while the strain with a single yciC mutation showed no
      phenotype. However, yciC was important for survival under zinc limitation when
      either troC or zinT was inactivated. The periplasmic zinc-binding protein, ZinT, 
      could not function when TroC was inactivated, suggesting that ZinT may interact
      with TroCBA in zinc uptake. Unlike many other bacteria, the ABC-type transporter 
      ZnuABC was not the major zinc uptake system in A. tumefaciens However, the
      important role of A. tumefaciens ZnuABC was revealed when TroCBA was impaired.
      The strain containing double mutations in the znuA and troC genes exhibited a
      growth defect in minimal medium. A. tumefaciens requires cooperation of zinc
      uptake systems and zinc chaperones, including TroCBA, ZnuABC, ZinT, and YciC, for
      survival under a wide range of zinc-limiting conditions. IMPORTANCE: Both host
      and pathogen battle over access to essential metals, including zinc. In low-zinc 
      environments, physiological responses that make it possible to acquire enough
      zinc are important for bacterial survival and could determine the outcome of
      host-pathogen interactions. A. tumefaciens was found to operate a novel pathway
      for zinc uptake in which ZinT functions in concert with the high-affinity zinc
      importer TroCBA.

TI  - Regulatory Activities of Four ArsR Proteins in Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A.
PG  - 3471-3480
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00262-16 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: ArsR is a well-studied transcriptional repressor that regulates
      microbe-arsenic interactions. Most microorganisms have an arsR gene, but in cases
      where multiple copies exist, the respective roles or potential functional overlap
      have not been explored. We examined the repressors encoded by arsR1 and arsR2
      (ars1 operon) and by arsR3 and arsR4 (ars2 operon) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      5A. ArsR1 and ArsR4 are very similar in their primary sequences and diverge
      phylogenetically from ArsR2 and ArsR3, which are also quite similar to one
      another. Reporter constructs (lacZ) for arsR1, arsR2, and arsR4 were all
      inducible by As(III), but expression of arsR3 (monitored by reverse transcriptase
      PCR) was not influenced by As(III) and appeared to be linked transcriptionally to
      an upstream lysR-type gene. Experiments using a combination of deletion mutations
      and additional reporter assays illustrated that the encoded repressors (i) are
      not all autoregulatory as is typically known for ArsR proteins, (ii) exhibit
      variable control of each other's encoding genes, and (iii) exert variable control
      of other genes previously shown to be under the control of ArsR1. Furthermore,
      ArsR2, ArsR3, and ArsR4 appear to have an activator-like function for some genes 
      otherwise repressed by ArsR1, which deviates from the well-studied repressor role
      of ArsR proteins. The differential regulatory activities suggest a complex
      regulatory network not previously observed in ArsR studies. The results indicate 
      that fine-scale ArsR sequence deviations of the reiterated regulatory proteins
      apparently translate to different regulatory roles. IMPORTANCE: Given the
      significance of the ArsR repressor in regulating various aspects of
      microbe-arsenic interactions, it is important to assess potential regulatory
      overlap and/or interference when a microorganism carries multiple copies of arsR 
      This study explores this issue and shows that the four arsR genes in A.
      tumefaciens 5A, associated with two separate ars operons, encode proteins
      exhibiting various degrees of functional overlap with respect to autoregulation
      and cross-regulation, as well as control of other functional genes. In some
      cases, differences in regulatory activity are associated with only limited
      differences in protein primary structure. The experiments summarized herein also 
      present evidence that ArsR proteins appear to have activator functions,
      representing novel regulatory activities for ArsR, previously known only to be a 
      repressor.

TI  - Improvement of soybean transformation via Agrobacterium tumefaciens methods
      involving alpha-aminooxyacetic acid and sonication treatments enlightened by gene
      expression profile analysis.
PG  - 1259-71
LID - 10.1007/s00299-016-1958-2 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: Antagonists and sonication treatment relieved the structural
      barriers of Agrobacterium entering into cells; hindered signal perception and
      transmission; alleviated defense responses and increased cell susceptibility to
      Agrobacterium infection. Soybean gene expression analysis was performed to
      elucidate the general response of soybean plant to Agrobacterium at an early
      stage of infection. Agrobacterium infection stimulated the PAMPs-triggered
      immunity (BRI1, BAK1, BZR1, FLS2 and EFR) and effector-triggered immunity (RPM1, 
      RPS2, RPS5, RIN4, and PBS1); up-regulated the transcript factors (WRKY25, WRKY29,
      MEKK1P, MKK4/5P and MYC2) in MAPK pathway; strengthened the biosynthesis of
      flavonoid and isoflavonoid in the second metabolism; finally led to a fierce
      defense response of soybean to Agrobacterium infection and thereby lower
      transformation efficiency. To overcome it, antagonist alpha-aminooxyacetic acid
      (AOA) and sonication treatment along with Agrobacterium infection were applied.
      This novel method dramatically decreased the expression of genes coding for F3'H,
      HCT, beta-glucosidase and IF7GT, etc., which are important for isoflavone
      biosynthesis or the interconversion of aglycones and glycon; genes coding for
      peroxidase, FLS2, PBS1 and transcription factor MYC2, etc., which are important
      components in plant-pathogen interaction; and genes coding for GPAT and
      alpha-L-fucosidase, which are important in polyesters formation in cell membrane 
      and the degradation of fucose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids on the
      external surface of cell membrane, respectively. This analysis implied that AOA
      and sonication treatment not only relieved the structural membrane barriers of
      Agrobacterium entering into cells, but also hindered the perception of 'invasion'
      signal on cell membrane and intercellular signal transmission, thus effectively
      alleviated the defense responses and increased the cell susceptibility to
      Agrobacterium infection. All these factors benefit the transformation process;
      other measures should also be further explored to improve soybean transformation.

      Protein-lysine Methyltransferase That Targets Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 and the
      beta Subunit of Electron Transfer Flavoprotein (ETFbeta).
PG  - 9581-95
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.709261 [doi]
AB  - Human METTL20 is a mitochondrial, lysine-specific methyltransferase that
      methylates the beta-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFbeta).
      Interestingly, putative METTL20 orthologues are found in a subset of
      alpha-proteobacteria, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens Using an activity-based
      approach, we identified in bacterial extracts two substrates of recombinant
      METTL20 from A. tumefaciens (AtMETTL20), namely ETFbeta and the ribosomal protein
      RpL7/L12. We show that AtMETTL20, analogous to the human enzyme, methylates
      ETFbeta on Lys-193 and Lys-196 both in vitro and in vivo ETF plays a key role in 
      mediating electron transfer from various dehydrogenases, and we found that its
      electron transferring ability was diminished by AtMETTL20-mediated methylation of
      ETFbeta. Somewhat surprisingly, AtMETTL20 also catalyzed monomethylation of
      RpL7/L12 on Lys-86, a common modification also found in many bacteria that lack
      METTL20. Thus, we here identify AtMETTL20 as the first enzyme catalyzing RpL7/L12
      methylation. In summary, here we have identified and characterized a novel
      bacterial lysine-specific methyltransferase with unprecedented dual substrate
      specificity within the seven beta-strand class of lysine-specific
      methyltransferases, as it targets two apparently unrelated substrates, ETFbeta
      and RpL7/L12. Moreover, the present work establishes METTL20-mediated methylation
      of ETFbeta as the first lysine methylation event occurring in both bacteria and
      humans.

AB  - In this study, N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), a member of the
      N-acyl-homoserine lactone class of microbial quorum sensing (QS) signaling
      molecules, was used to improve microbial flocculant production. After exogenous
      C6-HSL was added, exopolysaccharide concentration of microbial flocculants was
      improved by 1.6-fold and flocculation rate of microbial flocculants was increased
      by 10 %. Fermentation conditions with added C6-HSL were further optimized through
      response surface methodology. The obtained optimal fermentation conditions were
      as follows: added C6-HSL concentration of 0.45 muM, fermentation temperature of
      30.4 degrees C, and initial fermentation pH of 7.25. Under these optimal
      fermentation conditions, the resulting exopolysaccharide concentration was
      improved by 1.75-fold and flocculation rate was increased by 10 % compared with
      that of the control group. The yield of microbial flocculants was also improved
      by 1.75-fold. Results demonstrated that the existence of QS system in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain F2 played the important roles in the microbial
      flocculant production.

TI  - Identification and characterization of an anti-oxidative stress-associated mutant
      of Aspergillus fumigatus transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 2367-76
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.4839 [doi]
AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most common opportunistic pathogenic fungi,
      surviving in various environmental conditions. Maintenance of the redox
      homeostasis of the fungus relies upon the wellorganized regulation between
      reactive oxygen species generated by immune cells or its own organelles, and the 
      activated antioxidative stress mechanism. To investigate such a mechanism, the
      present study obtained a number of randomlyinserted mutants of A. fumigatus,
      mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In addition, a high throughput hydrogen
      peroxide screening system was established to examine ~1,000 mutants. A total of
      100 mutants exhibited changes in hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, among which a
      significant increase in sensitivity was observed in the AFM2658 mutant. Further
      investigations of the mutant were also performed, in which the sequence of this
      mutant was characterized using thermal asymmetric interlacedpolymerase chain
      reaction. This revealed that the insertion site was located on chromosome 2
      afu1_92, and the 96 bp sequence was knocked out, which partially comprised a
      sequence localized between the integral membrane protein coding region and the
      helixloophelix transcription factor coding region. A decrease in the levels of
      antioxidative stressassociated mRNAs were observed, and an increase in reactive
      oxygen species were detected using fluorescence. The results of the present study
      demonstrated that this sequence may have a protective role in A. fumigatus in the
      presence of oxidative stress.

TI  - An Improved Single-Step Cloning Strategy Simplifies the Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation (ATMT)-Based Gene-Disruption Method for
      Verticillium dahliae.
PG  - 645-52
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-10-15-0280-R [doi]
AB  - The soilborne fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae infects a broad range of plant
      species to cause severe diseases. The availability of Verticillium genome
      sequences has provided opportunities for large-scale investigations of individual
      gene function in Verticillium strains using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT)-based gene-disruption strategies. Traditional ATMT vectors 
      require multiple cloning steps and elaborate characterization procedures to
      achieve successful gene replacement; thus, these vectors are not suitable for
      high-throughput ATMT-based gene deletion. Several advancements have been made
      that either involve simplification of the steps required for gene-deletion vector
      construction or increase the efficiency of the technique for rapid recombinant
      characterization. However, an ATMT binary vector that is both simple and
      efficient is still lacking. Here, we generated a USER-ATMT dual-selection (DS)
      binary vector, which combines both the advantages of the USER single-step cloning
      technique and the efficiency of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
      negative-selection marker. Highly efficient deletion of three different genes in 
      V. dahliae using the USER-ATMT-DS vector enabled verification that this
      newly-generated vector not only facilitates the cloning process but also
      simplifies the subsequent identification of fungal homologous recombinants. The
      results suggest that the USER-ATMT-DS vector is applicable for efficient gene
      deletion and suitable for large-scale gene deletion in V. dahliae.

TI  - The Receiver of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirA Histidine Kinase Forms a
      Stable Interaction with VirG to Activate Virulence Gene Expression.
PG  - 1546
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01546 [doi]
AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens carries a virulence gene system that
      is required for the initiation of crown gall tumors on susceptible plants.
      Expression of the vir genes is activated by the VirA/VirG two component
      regulatory system. VirA is a histidine kinase which signals the presence of
      certain chemicals found at the site of a plant wound. The receiver domain located
      at its carboxyl terminus defines VirA as a hybrid histidine kinase. Here, we show
      that the VirA receiver interacts with the DNA-binding domain of VirG. This
      finding supports the hypothesis that the receiver acts as a recruiting factor for
      VirG. In addition, we show that removal of the VirA receiver allowed vir gene
      expression in response to glucose in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the
      receiver controls VirG activation and suggesting that the supplementary
      ChvE-sugar signal increases this activity.

TI  - Succinic Semialdehyde Promotes Prosurvival Capability of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 930-40
LID - 10.1128/JB.00373-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Succinic semialdehyde (SSA), an important metabolite of
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), is a ligand of the repressor AttJ regulating the 
      expression of the attJ-attKLM gene cluster in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. While the response of A. tumefaciens to GABA and the function of
      attKLM have been extensively studied, genetic and physiological responses of A.
      tumefaciens to SSA remain unknown. In combination with microarray and genetic
      approaches, this study sets out to explore new roles of the SSA-AttJKLM
      regulatory mechanism during bacterial infection. The results showed that SSA
      plays a key role in regulation of several bacterial activities, including
      C4-dicarboxylate utilization, nitrate assimilation, and resistance to oxidative
      stress. Interestingly, while the SSA relies heavily on the functional AttKLM in
      mediating nitrate assimilation and oxidative stress resistance, the compound
      could regulate utilization of C4-dicarboxylates independent of AttJKLM. We
      further provide evidence that SSA controls C4-dicarboxylate utilization through
      induction of an SSA importer and that disruption of attKLM attenuates the
      tumorigenicity of A. tumefaciens. Taken together, these findings indicate that
      SSA could be a potent plant signal which, together with AttKLM, plays a vital
      role in promoting the bacterial prosurvival abilities during infection.
      IMPORTANCE: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen causing crown gall
      diseases and has been well known as a powerful tool for plant genetic
      engineering. During the long history of microbe-host interaction, A. tumefaciens 
      has evolved the capabilities of recognition and response to plant-derived
      chemical metabolites. Succinic semialdehyde (SSA) is one such metabolite.
      Previous results have demonstrated that SSA functions to activate a
      quorum-quenching mechanism and thus to decrease the level of quorum-sensing
      signals, thereby avoiding the elicitation of a plant defense. Here, we studied
      the effect of SSA on gene expression at a genome-wide level and reported that SSA
      also promotes bacterial survival during infection. These findings provide a new
      insight on the biological significance of chemical signaling between agrobacteria
      and plant hosts.

TI  - Purification, crystallization and structural elucidation of
      D-galactaro-1,4-lactone cycloisomerase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens involved in
      pectin degradation.
PG  - 36-41

AB  - Pectin is found in the cell wall of plants and is often discarded as waste. A
      number of research groups are interested in redirecting this biomass waste stream
      for the production of fuel and bulk chemicals. The primary monomeric subunit of
      this polysaccharide is D-galacturonate, a six-carbon acid sugar that is degraded 
      in a five-step pathway to central metabolic intermediates by some bacteria,
      including Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In the third step of the pathway,
      D-galactaro-1,4-lactone is converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-threo-hexarate by a
      member of the mandelate racemase subgroup of the enolase superfamily with a novel
      activity for the superfamily. The 1.6 A resolution structure of this enzyme was
      determined, revealing an overall modified (beta/alpha)7beta TIM-barrel domain, a 
      hallmark of the superfamily. D-Galactaro-1,4-lactone was manually docked into the
      active site located at the interface between the N-terminal lid domain and the
      C-terminal barrel domain. On the basis of the position of the lactone in the
      active site, Lys166 is predicted to be the active-site base responsible for
      abstraction of the alpha proton. His296 on the opposite side of the active site
      is predicted to be the general acid that donates a proton to the beta carbon as
      the lactone ring opens. The lactone ring appears to be oriented within the active
      site by stacking interactions with Trp298.

TI  - Efficient Construction of Large Genomic Deletion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by 
      Combination of Cre/loxP System and Triple Recombineering.

AB  - In order to develop an efficient system for deleting genomic segment in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens to analyze gene functions and construct marker
      gene-free recombinant strains, a Cre recombinase expression plasmid was
      constructed by placing its encoding gene under the control of Ptet promoter and
      cloning into the plasmid replicable in both A. tumefaciens and E. coli. Triple
      recombineering was applied to efficiently construct integrative vectors which
      were used to introduce loxP sites and selection markers into the chromosome of A.
      tumefaciens. Cre recombinase could be properly induced by anhydrotetracycline in 
      A. tumefaciens, which was revealed by the fact that kanamycin resistance gene
      flanked by two parallel loxP sites was excised from the genome of A. tumefaciens 
      with virtually 100% efficiency. And what is more, an A. tumefaciens mutant
      carrying large-deletion (~85 kb) in genome was successfully constructed by
      Cre/loxP system. Here, we described the application of combination of Cre/loxP
      system and triple recombineering to efficiently excise genomic segment in A.
      tumefaciens, which also would facilitate efficient construction of multiple gene 
      disruptions in A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Nicotine Dehydrogenase Complexed with 6-Hydroxypseudooxynicotine Oxidase Involved
      in the Hybrid Nicotine-Degrading Pathway in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
PG  - 1745-1755
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03909-15 [doi]
AB  - Nicotine, a major toxic alkaloid in tobacco wastes, is degraded by bacteria,
      mainly via pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways. Previously, we discovered a new
      hybrid of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 
      and characterized its key enzyme 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP) hydroxylase.
      Here, we purified the nicotine dehydrogenase initializing the nicotine
      degradation from the strain and found that it forms a complex with a novel
      6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine oxidase. The purified complex is composed of three
      different subunits encoded by ndhAB and pno, where ndhA and ndhB overlap by 4 bp 
      and are approximately 26 kb away from pno. As predicted from the gene sequences
      and from chemical analyses, NdhA (82.4 kDa) and NdhB (17.1 kDa) harbor a
      molybdopterin cofactor and two [2Fe-2S] clusters, respectively, whereas Pno (73.3
      kDa) harbors an flavin mononucleotide and a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Mutants with
      disrupted ndhA or ndhB genes did not grow on nicotine but grew well on
      6-hydroxynicotine and HSP, whereas the pno mutant did not grow on nicotine or
      6-hydroxynicotine but grew well on HSP, indicating that NdhA and NdhB are
      responsible for initialization of nicotine oxidation. We successfully expressed
      pno in Escherichia coli and found that the recombinant Pno presented
      2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduction activity when it was coupled with
      6-hydroxynicotine oxidation. The determination of reaction products catalyzed by 
      the purified enzymes or mutants indicated that NdhAB catalyzed nicotine oxidation
      to 6-hydroxynicotine, whereas Pno oxidized 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine to
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylsemialdehyde pyridine. These results provide new insights
      into this novel hybrid pathway of nicotine degradation in A. tumefaciens S33.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the numerous factors influencing
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of Chinese cabbage
      (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis). Factors affecting transformation efficiency,
      such as age of explants, Agrobacterium concentration, and effect of
      acetosyringone, pre-cultivation, infection and co-cultivation time of
      Agrobacterium were examined. The pre-cultured hypocotyls from young seedlings
      prior to exposure to Agrobacterium showed higher shoot regeneration. The plant
      transformation with the modest A. tumefaciens concentrations (0.8 OD) and the 3
      days co-cultivation periods increased transformation efficiency. Plant growth
      hormones [1-naphthyl acetic acid (NAA) and 6-benzyl amino purine (BAP)] were
      essential for callus and shoot formation. Root formation was effective in half
      strength MS medium without supplementation of root-inducing hormones. To maintain
      selection pressure, plant subculture was carried out every 2 weeks with selective
      antibiotics. The putative transgenic plants were acclimatized in the greenhouse. 
      Polymerase chain reaction was performed to confirm the integration of T-DNA into 
      the genome of transgenic plants. A transformation efficiency of 15 % was
      obtained. This protocol allows effective transformation and indirect regeneration
      of Brassica rapa.

TI  - The plant GABA signaling downregulates horizontal transfer of the Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens virulence plasmid.
PG  - 974-83
LID - 10.1111/nph.13813 [doi]
AB  - In the tumor-inducing (Ti) Agrobacterium tumefaciens, quorum sensing activates
      the horizontal transfer of the virulent Ti plasmid. In pure culture, this process
      can be impaired by the A. tumefaciens BlcC lactonase, whose expression is induced
      by gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA). It was therefore hypothesized that host GABA
      content might modulate quorum sensing and virulence gene dissemination during A. 
      tumefaciens infection. We examined GABA metabolism and transport in Arabidopsis
      thaliana tumors combining transcriptomic, metabolomic and histological
      approaches. In addition, using genetically modified plants and bacteria, we
      evaluated the impact of plant host GABA content on Ti plasmid dissemination. The 
      results showed that GABA and free proline, which acts as an antagonist of GABA
      uptake in A. tumefaciens, accumulated in wild-type tumors relative to uninfected 
      plant tissues. Moreover, comparisons of tumors induced on Col-0 and her1 plants
      showed that the increase in the plant GABA : proline ratio was associated with
      both the upregulated expression of the blcC gene and the decreased dissemination 
      of Ti plasmid in tumor-colonizing A. tumefaciens populations. This work
      demonstrates experimentally that the variation in the GABA content in plant
      tumors can interfere with the dissemination of A. tumefaciens Ti plasmids, and
      therefore highlights plant GABA content as an important trait in the struggle
      against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Discrete Responses to Limitation for Iron and Manganese in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens: Influence on Attachment and Biofilm Formation.
PG  - 816-29
LID - 10.1128/JB.00668-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Transition metals such as iron and manganese are crucial trace
      nutrients for the growth of most bacteria, functioning as catalytic cofactors for
      many essential enzymes. Dedicated uptake and regulatory systems have evolved to
      ensure their acquisition for growth, while preventing toxicity. Transcriptomic
      analysis of the iron- and manganese-responsive regulons of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens revealed that there are discrete regulatory networks that respond to 
      changes in iron and manganese levels. Complementing earlier studies, the
      iron-responsive gene network is quite large and includes many aspects of
      iron-dependent metabolism and the iron-sparing response. In contrast, the
      manganese-responsive network is restricted to a limited number of genes, many of 
      which can be linked to transport and utilization of the transition metal. Several
      of the target genes predicted to drive manganese uptake are required for growth
      under manganese-limited conditions, and an A. tumefaciens mutant with a manganese
      transport deficiency is attenuated for plant virulence. Iron and manganese
      limitation independently inhibit biofilm formation by A. tumefaciens, and several
      candidate genes that could impact biofilm formation were identified in each
      regulon. The biofilm-inhibitory effects of iron and manganese do not rely on
      recognized metal-responsive transcriptional regulators, suggesting alternate
      mechanisms influencing biofilm formation. However, under low-manganese conditions
      the dcpA operon is upregulated, encoding a system that controls levels of the
      cyclic di-GMP second messenger. Mutation of this regulatory pathway dampens the
      effect of manganese limitation. IMPORTANCE: Responses to changes in transition
      metal levels, such as those of manganese and iron, are important for normal
      metabolism and growth in bacteria. Our study used global gene expression
      profiling to understand the response of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens to changes of transition metal availability. Among the properties
      that are affected by both iron and manganese levels are those required for normal
      surface attachment and biofilm formation, but the requirement for each of these
      transition metals is mechanistically independent from the other.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation: An efficient tool for
      insertional mutagenesis and targeted gene disruption in Harpophora oryzae.

AB  - The endophytic filamentous fungus Harpophora oryzae is a beneficial endosymbiont 
      isolated from the wild rice. H. oryzae could not only effectively improve growth 
      rate and biomass yield of rice crops, but also induce systemic resistance against
      the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was employed and optimized to modify
      the H. oryzae genes by either random DNA fragment integration or targeted gene
      replacement. Our results showed that co-cultivation of H. oryzae conidia with A. 
      tumefaciens in the presence of acetosyringone for 48 h at 22 degrees C could lead
      to a relatively highest frequency of transformation, and 200 muM acetosyringone
      (AS) pre-cultivation of A. tumefaciens is also suggested. ATMT-mediated knockout 
      mutagenesis was accomplished with the gene-deletion cassettes using a yeast
      homologous recombination method with a yeast-Escherichia-Agrobacterium shuttle
      vector pKOHo. Using the ATMT-mediated knockout mutagenesis, we successfully
      deleted three genes of H. oryzae (HoATG5, HoATG7, and HoATG8), and then got the
      null mutants DeltaHoatg5, DeltaHoatg7, and DeltaHoatg8. These results suggest
      that ATMT is an efficient tool for gene modification including randomly
      insertional mutagenesis and gene deletion mutagenesis in H. oryzae.

TI  - The Essential Role of Spermidine in Growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Is
      Determined by the 1,3-Diaminopropane Moiety.
PG  - 491-9
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.5b00893 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitous polyamine spermidine is indispensable for eukaryotic growth and
      cell proliferation. A conserved vital function of spermidine across eukaryotes is
      conferred by its aminobutyl group that is transferred to a single lysine in
      translation factor eIF5A to form the essential hypusine post-translational
      modification required for cellular translation. In direct contrast, although
      spermidine is absolutely essential for growth of alpha-proteobacterial plant
      pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we have found, by employing a suite of
      natural polyamines and synthetic methylated spermidine analogues together with
      spermidine biosynthetic mutants, that it is solely the 1,3-diaminopropane moiety 
      of spermidine that is required for growth. Indeed, any polyamine containing an
      intact terminal 1,3-diaminopropane moiety can replace spermidine for growth,
      including the simple diamine 1,3-diaminopropane itself, a paradigm shift in
      understanding polyamine function in bacteria. We have identified for the first
      time a spermidine retroconversion activity in bacteria, producing diamine
      putrescine from triamine spermidine; however, exogenously supplied tetraamine
      spermine is resistant to retroconversion. When spermidine levels are
      pharmacologically decreased, synthesis of spermine from spermidine is induced via
      the same biosynthetic enzymes, carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase and
      carboxyspermidine decarboxylase that produce spermidine from putrescine, the
      first identification of a spermine biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. This also
      suggests that spermidine represses spermine biosynthesis, but when spermidine
      levels decrease, it is then converted by carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase and
      decarboxylase enzymes to spermine, which is resistant to retroconversion and
      constitutes a sequestered pool of protected 1,3-diaminopropane modules required
      for growth. We also identify an efficient N-acetylspermidine deacetylase
      activity, indicative of a sophisticated bacterial polyamine homeostasis system.

AB  - Steady increase in global population poses several challenges to plant science
      research, including demand for increased crop productivity, grain yield,
      nutritional quality and improved tolerance to different environmental factors.
      Transgene-based approaches are promising to address these challenges by
      transferring potential candidate genes to host organisms through different
      strategies. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is one such strategy which is
      well known for enabling efficient gene transfer in both monocot and dicots. Due
      to its versatility, this technique underwent several advancements including
      development of improved in vitro plant regeneration system, co-cultivation and
      selection methods, and use of hyper-virulent strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      harbouring super-binary vectors. The efficiency of this method has also been
      enhanced by the use of acetosyringone to induce the activity of vir genes, silver
      nitrate to reduce the Agrobacterium-induced necrosis and cysteine to avoid callus
      browning during co-cultivation. In the last two decades, extensive efforts have
      been invested towards achieving efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
      in cereals. Though high-efficiency transformation systems have been developed for
      rice and maize, comparatively lesser progress has been reported in other
      graminaceous crops. In this context, the present review discusses the progress
      made in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system in rice, maize, wheat,
      barley, sorghum, sugarcane, Brachypodium, millets, bioenergy and forage and turf 
      grasses. In addition, it also provides an overview of the genes that have been
      recently transferred to these graminaceous crops using Agrobacterium, bottlenecks
      in this technique and future possibilities for crop improvement.

TI  - Constitutive expression of the tzs gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens virG
      mutant strains is responsible for improved transgenic plant regeneration in
      cotton meristem transformation.
PG  - 601-11
LID - 10.1007/s00299-015-1906-6 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE : virG mutant strains of a nopaline type of Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      increase the transformation frequency in cotton meristem transformation.
      Constitutive cytokinin expression from the tzs gene in the virG mutant strains is
      responsible for the improvement. Strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were tested
      for their ability to improve cotton meristem transformation frequency. Two
      disarmed A. tumefaciens nopaline strains with either a virGN54D constitutively
      active mutation or virGI77V hypersensitive induction mutation significantly
      increased the transformation frequency in a cotton meristem transformation
      system. The virG mutant strains resulted in greener explants after three days of 
      co-culture in the presence of light, which could be attributed to a cytokinin
      effect of the mutants. A tzs knockout strain of virGI77V mutant showed more
      elongated, less green explants and decreased cotton transformation frequency, as 
      compared to a wild type parental strain, suggesting that expression of the tzs
      gene is required for transformation frequency improvement in cotton meristem
      transformation. In vitro cytokinin levels in culture media were tenfold higher in
      the virGN54D strain, and approximately 30-fold higher in the virGI77V strain, in 
      the absence of acetosyringone induction, compared to the wild type strain. The
      cytokinin level in the virGN54D strain is further increased upon acetosyringone
      induction, while the cytokinin level in the virGI77V mutant is decreased by
      induction, suggesting that different tzs gene expression regulation mechanisms
      are present in the two virG mutant strains. Based on these data, we suggest that 
      the increased cytokinin levels play a major role in increasing Agrobacterium
      attachment and stimulating localized division of the attached plant cells.

AB  - To develop a genetic transformation method of Aureobasidium pullulans and T-DNA
      insertion for high-efficient screening of polymalic acid (PMA) producing strain. 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-AGL1, containing the selection genes encoding
      hygromycin B phosphotase or phosphinothricin acetyltranferase, was used to
      transform Aureobasidium pullulans CCTCC M2012223 and transformants were confirmed
      by colony PCR method. Transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutants were cultured
      in microwell plate, and screened for high-titer PMA producing strain according to
      the pH response model. DNA walking was used to detect the insertion sites in the 
      mutant. Results show that the selection markers could stably generated in the
      transformants, and 80 to 120 transformants could be found per 10(7) single cells.
      A high-titer PMA mutant H27 was obtained, giving a good PMA production caused by 
      the disruption of phosphoglycerate mutase, that increased by 24.5% compared with 
      the control. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and high-efficient
      screening method were successfully developed, which will be helpful for genetic
      transformation of Aureobasidium pullulans and its functional genes discovery.

LID - 10.1007/s11103-015-0407-x [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirG response regulator of the VirA/VirG
      two-component system was adapted to function in tobacco protoplasts. The
      subcellular localization of VirG and VirA proteins transiently expressed in onion
      cells was determined using GFP fusions. Preliminary studies using Gal4DBD-VP16
      fusions with VirG and Escherichia coli UhpA, and NarL response regulators
      indicated compatibility of these bacterial proteins with the eukaryotic
      transcriptional apparatus. A strong transcriptional activator based on tandem
      activation domains from the Drosophila fushi tarazu and Herpes simplex VP16 was
      created. Selected configurations of the two-site Gal4-vir box GUS reporters were 
      activated by chimeric effectors dependent on either the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding
      domain or that of VirG. Transcriptional induction of the GUS reporter was highest
      for the VirE19-element promoter with both constitutive and wild-type VirG-tandem 
      activation domain effectors. Multiple VirE19 elements increased the reporter
      activity proportionately, indicating that the VirG DNA binding domain was
      functional in plants. The VirG constitutive-Q-VP16 effector was more active than 
      the VirG wild-type. In both the constitutive and wild-type forms of VirG, Q-VP16 
      activated transcription of the GUS reporter best when located at the C-terminus, 
      i.e. juxtaposed to the VirG DNA binding domain. These results demonstrate the
      possibility of using DNA binding domains from bacterial response regulators and
      their cognate binding elements in the engineering of plant gene expression.

      Periplasmic (TRAP) Transporter GaaPQM in Virulence Gene Expression.
PG  - 1136-1146
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02891-15 [doi]
AB  - Monosaccharides capable of serving as nutrients for the soil bacterium
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens are also inducers of the vir regulon present in the
      tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of this plant pathogen. One such monosaccharide is
      galacturonate, the predominant monomer of pectin found in plant cell walls. This 
      ligand is recognized by the periplasmic sugar binding protein ChvE, which
      interacts with the VirA histidine kinase that controls vir gene expression.
      Although ChvE is also a member of the ChvE-MmsAB ABC transporter involved in the 
      utilization of many neutral sugars, it is not involved in galacturonate
      utilization. In this study, a putative tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic
      (TRAP) transporter, GaaPQM, is shown to be essential for the utilization of
      galacturonic acid; we show that residue R169 in the predicted sugar binding site 
      of the GaaP is required for activity. The gene upstream of gaaPQM (gaaR) encodes 
      a member of the GntR family of regulators. GaaR is shown to repress the
      expression of gaaPQM, and the repression is relieved in the presence of the
      substrate for GaaPQM. Moreover, GaaR is shown to bind putative promoter regions
      in the sequences required for galacturonic acid utilization. Finally, A.
      tumefaciens strains carrying a deletion of gaaPQM are more sensitive to
      galacturonate as an inducer of vir gene expression, while the overexpression of
      gaaPQM results in strains being less sensitive to this vir inducer. This supports
      a model in which transporter activity is crucial in ensuring that vir gene
      expression occurs only at sites of high ligand concentration, such as those at a 
      plant wound site.

AB  - In the present study, a protocol for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation has been optimized for Woodfordia fruticosa (L.) Kurz. Precultured
      axenic leaf segments were co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404
      harboring the binary plasmid pCAMBIA1301 with beta-glucuronidase (uidA)
      containing intron as the reporter gene and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) as
      a selectable marker gene. After 3 days of co-cultivation, leaf segments were
      cultured on MS medium containing Thidiazuron (TDZ 4.54 muM) and Indole-3-acetic
      acid IAA (1.14 muM) + 20 mg/l hygromycin + 200 mg/l cefotaxime (PTSM1) for 4
      weeks (includes a single subculture onto the same medium at a 2 week interval).
      They were subsequently cultured for 3 weeks on MS medium containing Thidiazuron
      (TDZ 4.54 muM) and Indole-3-acetic acid IAA (1.14 muM) + 25 mg/l hygromycin + 100
      mg/l cefotaxime (PTSM2) medium for further development and shoot elongation. The 
      hygromycin resistant shoots were rooted on a rooting medium (PTRM) containing
      half strength MS medium + 4.90 muM IBA + 25 mg/l hygromycin. A highest
      transformation efficiency of 44.5% with a mean number of 2.6 transgenic shoots
      per explant was achieved. Successful transformation was confirmed by the
      histochemical GUS activity of the regenerated shoots, PCR and RT-PCR analysis
      using respective primers. Southern blot analysis revealed that the hpt gene
      integrated into the genome of transgenic W. fruticosa. Establishment of genetic
      transformation protocol may facilitate the improvement of this medicinal plant in
      terms of enhancement of secondary metabolites.

      derived from mature embryos are transformed using Agrobacterium strain LBA4404
      that carries the BIBAC vector and the super-virulent helper plasmid pCH32.
      Transformed calli are then regenerated using optimized media and tested for
      transgene integration by PCR, GUS assay, and Southern blot analyses.

AB  - Low transformation efficiency is one of the main limiting factors in the
      establishment of genetic transformation of wheat via Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
      To determine more favorable conditions for T-DNA delivery and explant
      regeneration after infection, this study investigated combinations of
      acetosyringone concentration and pH variation in the inoculation and
      co-cultivation media and co-culture temperatures using immature embryos from two 
      Brazilian genotypes (BR 18 Terena and PF 020037). Based on transient expression
      of uidA, the most favorable conditions for T-DNA delivery were culture media with
      pH 5.0 and 5.4 combined with co-culture temperatures of 22 degrees C and 25
      degrees C, and a 400 muM acetosyringone supplement. These conditions resulted in 
      blue foci in 81% of the embryos. Media with more acidic pH also presented reduced
      A. tumefaciens overgrowth during co-culture, and improved regeneration frequency 
      of the inoculated explants. BR 18 Terena was more susceptible to infection by A. 
      tumefaciens than PF 020037. We found that it is possible to improve T-DNA
      delivery and explant regeneration by adjusting factors involved in the early
      stages of A. tumefaciens infection. This can contribute to establishing a stable 
      transformation procedure in the future.

AB  - Innovations in the discovery of the functions of uncharacterized proteins/enzymes
      have become increasingly important as advances in sequencing technology flood
      protein databases with an exponentially growing number of open reading frames.
      This study documents one such innovation developed by the Enzyme Function
      Initiative (EFI; U54GM093342), the use of solute-binding proteins for transport
      systems to identify novel metabolic pathways. In a previous study, this strategy 
      was applied to the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters. Here, we 
      apply this strategy to the ATP-binding cassette transporters and report the
      discovery of novel catabolic pathways for d-altritol and galactitol in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. These efforts resulted in the description of three
      novel enzymatic reactions as follows: 1) oxidation of d-altritol to d-tagatose
      via a dehydrogenase in Pfam family PF00107, a previously unknown reaction; 2)
      phosphorylation of d-tagatose to d-tagatose 6-phosphate via a kinase in Pfam
      family PF00294, a previously orphan EC number; and 3) epimerization of d-tagatose
      6-phosphate C-4 to d-fructose 6-phosphate via a member of Pfam family PF08013,
      another previously unknown reaction. The epimerization reaction catalyzed by a
      member of PF08013 is especially noteworthy, because the functions of members of
      PF08013 have been unknown. These discoveries were assisted by the following two
      synergistic bioinformatics web tools made available by the Enzyme Function
      Initiative: the EFI-Enzyme Similarity Tool and the EFI-Genome Neighborhood Tool.

TI  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence protein VirE3 is a transcriptional
      activator of the F-box gene VBF.
PG  - 914-24
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13048 [doi]
AB  - During Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of plant cells a part of
      the tumour-inducing plasmid, T-DNA, is integrated into the host genome. In
      addition, a number of virulence proteins are translocated into the host cell. The
      virulence protein VirE3 binds to the Arabidopsis thaliana pBrp protein, a
      plant-specific general transcription factor of the TFIIB family. To study a
      possible role for VirE3 in transcriptional regulation, we stably expressed virE3 
      in A. thaliana under control of a tamoxifen-inducible promoter. By RNA sequencing
      we showed that upon expression of virE3 the RNA levels of 607 genes were
      increased more than three-fold and those of 132 genes decreased more than
      three-fold. One of the strongly activated genes was that encoding VBF
      (At1G56250), an F-box protein that may affect the levels of the VirE2 and VIP1
      proteins. Using Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts we showed that VirE3
      stimulates the VBF promoter, especially when co-expressed with pBrp. Although
      pBrp is localized at the external surface of plastids, co-expression of VirE3 and
      pBrp in Arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts resulted in the accumulation of
      pBrp in the nucleus. Our results suggest that VirE3 affects the transcriptional
      machinery of the host cell to favour the transformation process.

AB  - DOG(R)1, which encodes 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate phosphatase, has been used as a
      selectable marker gene to produce transgenic plants. In this study, a
      transformation vector, pBIDOG, which contains the DOG(R)1 gene, was transformed
      into oil palm embryogenic calli (EC) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
      LBA4404. Transformed EC were exposed to 400 mg l(-1) 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) as
      the selection agent. 2-DOG resistant tissues were regenerated into whole
      plantlets on various regeneration media containing the same concentration of
      2-DOG. The plantlets were later transferred into soil and grown in a biosafety
      screenhouse. PCR and subsequently Southern blot analyses were carried out to
      confirm the integration of the transgene in the plantlets. A transformation
      efficiency of about 1.0% was obtained using DOG(R)1 gene into the genome of oil
      palm. This result demonstrates the potential of using combination of DOG(R)1 gene
      and 2-DOG for regenerating transgenic oil palm.

AB  - Armillaria mellea is a serious pathogen of horticultural and agricultural systems
      in Europe and North America. The lack of a reliable in vitro fruiting system for 
      heterothallic A. mellea has hindered research and required dependence on
      intermittently available wild-collected basidiospores of endemic genotypes,
      necessitating the use of variable genetic material in transformation studies.
      Here we describe a reliable, reproducible in vitro fruiting method for
      heterothallic A. mellea from the western US. Isolates and growth conditions were 
      evaluated to determine effective fruiting conditions. Following medium
      colonisation for 4 weeks, cultures were incubated under warm/bright conditions
      for 4-6 weeks before incubation in dim/cool conditions. Primordia emerged within 
      3-4 weeks following a temperature decrease and this was most efficient when
      coupled with a light reduction. Basidiocarps matured within 3-4 weeks and
      produced viable basidiospores. Agrobacterium tumefaciens and vectors were
      evaluated by transformation of in vitro-produced basidiospores and a versatile
      transformation vector was constructed to simplify promoter and marker gene
      exchange using homologous recombination in yeast. Fruiting bodies and viable
      basidiospores of A. mellea have been reliably produced in vitro which, coupled
      with the enhanced knowledge of suitable A. tumefaciens strains and vectors for
      transformation, will assist future genetic research into this important pathogen.

AB  - Plants have elaborate defensive machinery to protect against numerous pathogens
      and insects. Plant hormones function as modulators of defensive mechanisms to
      maintain plant resistance to natural enemies. Our recent study suggests that
      salicylic acid (SA) is the primary phytohormone regulating plant responses to
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection. Tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana Domin.)
      immune responses against Agrobacterium-mediated crown gall disease were activated
      by exposure to the sucking insect whitefly, which stimulated SA biosynthesis in
      aerial tissues; in turn, SA synthesized in aboveground tissues systemically
      modulated SA secretion in root tissues. Further investigation revealed that
      endogenous SA biosynthesis negatively modulated Agrobacterium-mediated plant
      genetic transformation. Our study provides novel evidence that activation of the 
      SA-signaling pathway mediated by a sucking insect infestation has a pivotal role 
      in subsequently attenuating Agrobacterium infection. These results demonstrate
      new insights into interspecies cross-talking among insects, plants, and soil
      bacteria.

TI  - PopZ identifies the new pole, and PodJ identifies the old pole during polar
      growth in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 11666-71
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1515544112 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens elongates by addition of peptidoglycan (PG) only at the
      pole created by cell division, the growth pole, whereas the opposite pole, the
      old pole, is inactive for PG synthesis. How Agrobacterium assigns and maintains
      pole asymmetry is not understood. Here, we investigated whether polar growth is
      correlated with novel pole-specific localization of proteins implicated in a
      variety of growth and cell division pathways. The cell cycle of A. tumefaciens
      was monitored by time-lapse and superresolution microscopy to image the
      localization of A. tumefaciens homologs of proteins involved in cell division, PG
      synthesis and pole identity. FtsZ and FtsA accumulate at the growth pole during
      elongation, and improved imaging reveals FtsZ disappears from the growth pole and
      accumulates at the midcell before FtsA. The L,D-transpeptidase Atu0845 was
      detected mainly at the growth pole. A. tumefaciens specific pole-organizing
      protein (Pop) PopZAt and polar organelle development (Pod) protein PodJAt
      exhibited dynamic yet distinct behavior. PopZAt was found exclusively at the
      growing pole and quickly switches to the new growth poles of both siblings
      immediately after septation. PodJAt is initially at the old pole but then also
      accumulates at the growth pole as the cell cycle progresses suggesting that
      PodJAt may mediate the transition of the growth pole to an old pole. Thus, PopZAt
      is a marker for growth pole identity, whereas PodJAt identifies the old pole.

AB  - Two proteins, SghA and SghR, which were recently identified and characterized as 
      novel bacterial virulence factors regulating the infection of plant hosts by
      Agrobacterium, were cloned, overexpressed and purified with high yield. Both SghA
      and SghR form dimers in solution. The purified SghA and SghR were crystallized
      and the crystals diffracted to 1.9 and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. Data were 
      collected and processed, and the crystallographic parameters were within
      acceptable ranges. These results will help in the determination of their
      structures in order to uncover the molecular mechanism of how these two proteins 
      together control the release of plant defence signals against agrobacteria during
      pathogen-host interaction.

PG  - 1730-1740

AB  - The putative zinc exporters ZntA (a P1B-type ATPase) and ZntB (2-TM-GxN family)
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens were characterized. The expression of the zntA gene 
      is inducible by CdCl2, ZnCl2 and CoCl2, of which CdCl2 is the most potent
      inducer, whereas zntB is constitutively expressed. The metal-induced expression
      of zntA is controlled by the MerR-like regulator ZntR. The zntA and zntR mutants 
      were highly sensitive to CdCl2 and ZnCl2, and CoCl2 sensitivity was demonstrated 
      to a lesser extent. By contrast, the zntB mutant showed similar levels of metal
      resistance to the WT strain. Even in the zntA mutant background, zntB did not
      play an apparent role in metal resistance under the conditions tested. The
      inactivation of zntA increased the accumulation of intracellular cadmium and
      zinc, and conferred hyper-resistance to H2O2. Thus, the metal transporter ZntA
      and its regulator ZntR are important for controlling zinc homeostasis and cadmium
      and cobalt detoxification. The loss of either the zntA or zntR gene did not
      affect the virulence of A. tumefaciens in Nicotiana benthamiana.

AB  - An Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system for the entomopathogenic 
      fungus Nomuraea rileyi was established. Three binary T-DNA vectors, pPZP-Hph,
      pPZP-Hph-RNAi and pPZP-Hph-DsRed2, were constructed. The trpc promoter from
      Aspergillus nidulans was used as the cis-regulatory element to drive the
      expression of hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene and DsRed2, which
      conferred the hygromycin B (Hyg B) resistance and red fluorescence visualization,
      respectively. The blastospores and conidia were used as the recipients. The
      blastospores' transformation efficiency reached approximately 20-40 transformants
      per 10(6) blastospores, whereas the conidia were not transformed. Based on an
      analysis of five generations of subcultures, PCR and Southern blotting assays,
      the Ptrpc-hph cassette had integrated into the genomes of all transformants,
      which contained single copy of the hph gene and showed mitotic stability.
      Abundant altered morphologic phenotypes in colonies, blastospores and hyphae
      formations were observed in the arbitrary insertional mutants of N. rileyi, which
      made it possible to study the relationships between the functions and the
      interrupted genes over the whole genome. The transformation protocol will promote
      the functional characterization of genes, and the construction of genetically
      engineered strains of this important entomopathogenic fungus, and potentially of 
      other similar fungal pathogens.

TI  - A Pyranose-2-Phosphate Motif Is Responsible for Both Antibiotic Import and
      Quorum-Sensing Regulation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e1005071

AB  - Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) in association with ABC transporters select
      and import a wide variety of ligands into bacterial cytoplasm. They can also take
      up toxic molecules, as observed in the case of the phytopathogen Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens strain C58. This organism contains a PBP called AccA that mediates
      the import of the antibiotic agrocin 84, as well as the opine agrocinopine A that
      acts as both a nutrient and a signalling molecule for the dissemination of
      virulence genes through quorum-sensing. Here, we characterized the binding mode
      of AccA using purified agrocin 84 and synthetic agrocinopine A by X-ray
      crystallography at very high resolution and performed affinity measurements.
      Structural and affinity analyses revealed that AccA recognizes an uncommon and
      specific motif, a pyranose-2-phosphate moiety which is present in both imported
      molecules via the L-arabinopyranose moiety in agrocinopine A and the
      D-glucopyranose moiety in agrocin 84. We hypothesized that AccA is a gateway
      allowing the import of any compound possessing a pyranose-2-phosphate motif at
      one end. This was structurally and functionally confirmed by experiments using
      four synthetic compounds: agrocinopine 3'-O-benzoate,
      L-arabinose-2-isopropylphosphate, L-arabinose-2-phosphate and
      D-glucose-2-phosphate. By combining affinity measurements and in vivo assays, we 
      demonstrated that both L-arabinose-2-phosphate and D-glucose-2-phosphate, which
      are the AccF mediated degradation products of agrocinopine A and agrocin 84
      respectively, interact with the master transcriptional regulator AccR and
      activate the quorum-sensing signal synthesis and Ti plasmid transfer in A.
      tumefaciens C58. Our findings shed light on the role of agrocinopine and
      antibiotic agrocin 84 on quorum-sensing regulation in A. tumefaciens and reveal
      how the PBP AccA acts as vehicle for the importation of both molecules by means
      of a key-recognition motif. It also opens future possibilities for the rational
      design of antibiotic and anti-virulence compounds against A. tumefaciens or other
      pathogens possessing similar PBPs.

TI  - D101 is critical for the function of AttJ, a repressor of quorum quenching system
      in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 623-32
LID - 10.1007/s12275-015-5100-x [doi]
AB  - The quorum quenching system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is specifically
      activated upon entering the stationary phase. Evidence has shown that this system
      includes two key components: the IclR-type transcriptional factor AttJ (also
      named as BlcR) and the AHL-lactonase AttM (also named as BlcC). At exponential
      phase, AttJ binds to the promoter region of attM and thus suppresses the
      expression of attM. At stationary phase, however, the small molecule SSA directly
      binds to AttJ and relieves its inhibition of AttJ and thereby triggers the
      expression of attM. While the regulation of AttM has been extensively
      investigated, little is known about the regulation of AttJ. In this study, we
      demonstrated the D101 amino acid of AttJ is essential for the AttJ function. In
      vitro, the variant protein of AttJD101H appeared to be readily aggregated. In
      vivo, the D101H mutation in AttJ entirely abolished the inhibitory activity of
      AttJ and overexpressed attM in A. tumefaciens A6. In addition, D101H mutation led
      to an overexpression of attJ, indicating an auto-regulatory mechanism for the
      attJ regulation. Put together, these findings demonstrate that D101 is an
      important amino acid for the transcription activity of AttJ and the transcription
      of attJ is regulated by a negative feedback loop. These results expand previous
      biochemical characterization of AttJ and provide new mechanistic insights into
      the regulation of quorum quenching in A. tumefaciens.

AB  - Ticks transmit infectious agents to humans and other animals. Genetic
      manipulation of vectors like ticks could enhance the development of alternative
      disease control strategies. Transgene expression using the phytopathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been shown to promote the genetic modification of
      non-plant cells. In the present work we developed T-DNA constructs for A.
      tumefaciens to mediate transgene expression in HeLa cells as well as
      Rhipicephalus microplus tick cells. Translational fusions eGfp:eGfp or
      Salp15:eGfp, including the enhanced-green fluorescent protein and the Ixodes
      scapularis salivary factor SALP15 genes, were constructed using the CaMV 35S
      (cauliflower mosaic virus) promoter, "PBm" tick promoter (R. microplus pyrethroid
      metabolizing esterase gene) or the Simian Virus SV40 promoter. Confocal
      microscopy, RT-PCR and Western-blot assays demonstrated transgene(s) expression
      in both cell lines. Transgene expression was also achieved in vivo, in both R.
      microplus and I. scapularis larvae utilizing a soaking method including the A.
      tumefaciens donor cells and confirmed by nested-RT-PCR showing eGfp or Salp15
      poly-A-mRNA(s). This strategy opens up a new avenue to express exogenous genes in
      ticks and represents a potential breakthrough for the study of tick-host
      pathophysiology.

      double-site variant (I33L-S213C) d-psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase) from
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens was highest at 24 h of cultivation time in Terrific

      production of d-psicose from d-fructose by whole recombinant cells with the
      highest specific activity were optimal at 60 degrees C, pH 8.5, 4 g/l cells, and 
      700 g/l d-fructose. Under these conditions, whole recombinant cells produced 230 
      g/l d-psicose after 40 min, with a conversion yield of 33% (w/w), a volumetric
      productivity of 345 g/l/h, and a specific productivity of 86.2 g/g/h. These are
      the highest conversion yield and volumetric and specific productivities of

AB  - Plant-targeted pCB302 plasmids containing sequences encoding gfp fusions with a
      microtubule-binding domain; gfp with the fimbrin actin-binding domain 2; and gfp 
      with AtRACK1C from Arabidopsis thaliana, all harbored in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, were used to assay heterologous expression on three different clades
      of the photosynthetic dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium. Accessibility to the
      resistant cell wall and through the plasma membrane of these dinoflagellates was 
      gained after brief but vigorous shaking in the presence of glass beads and
      polyethylene glycol. A resistance gene to the herbicide Basta allowed appropriate
      selection of the cells expressing the hybrid proteins, which showed a
      characteristic green fluorescence, although they appeared to lose their
      photosynthetic pigments and did not further divide. Cell GFP expression frequency
      measured as green fluorescence emission yielded 839 per every 106 cells for
      Symbiodinium kawagutii, followed by 640 and 460 per every 106 cells for
      Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Symbiodinium sp. Mf11, respectively. Genomic PCR
      with specific primers amplified the AtRACK1C and gfp sequences after selection in
      all clades, thus revealing their presence in the cells. RT-PCR from RNA of S.
      kawagutii co-incubated with A. tumefaciens harboring each of the three vectors
      with their respective constructs, amplified products corresponding to the
      heterologous gfp sequence while no products were obtained from three distinct
      negative controls. The reported procedure shows that mild abrasion followed by
      co-incubation with A. tumefaciens harboring heterologous plasmids with CaMV35S
      and nos promoters can lead to expression of the encoded proteins into the
      Symbiodinium cells in culture. Despite the obvious drawbacks of the procedure,
      this is an important first step towards a stable transformation of Symbiodinium.

      Plant and Nonplant Organisms.

AB  - Agrobacterium species are soilborne gram-negative bacteria exhibiting
      predominantly a saprophytic lifestyle. Only a few of these species are capable of
      parasitic growth on plants, causing either hairy root or crown gall diseases. The
      core of the infection strategy of pathogenic Agrobacteria is a genetic
      transformation of the host cell, via stable integration into the host genome of a
      DNA fragment called T-DNA. This genetic transformation results in oncogenic
      reprogramming of the host to the benefit of the pathogen. This unique ability of 
      interkingdom DNA transfer was largely used as a tool for genetic engineering.
      Thus, the artificial host range of Agrobacterium is continuously expanding and
      includes plant and nonplant organisms. The increasing availability of genomic
      tools encouraged genome-wide surveys of T-DNA tagged libraries, and the pattern
      of T-DNA integration in eukaryotic genomes was studied. Therefore, data have been
      collected in numerous laboratories to attain a better understanding of T-DNA
      integration mechanisms and potential biases. This review focuses on the
      intranuclear mechanisms necessary for proper targeting and stable expression of
      Agrobacterium oncogenic T-DNA in the host cell. More specifically, the role of
      genome features and the putative involvement of host's transcriptional machinery 
      in relation to the T-DNA integration and effects on gene expression are
      discussed. Also, the mechanisms underlying T-DNA integration into specific genome
      compartments is reviewed, and a theoretical model for T-DNA intranuclear
      targeting is presented.

TI  - A Pterin-Dependent Signaling Pathway Regulates a Dual-Function Diguanylate
      Cyclase-Phosphodiesterase Controlling Surface Attachment in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - e00156
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00156-15 [doi]
LID - e00156-15 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The motile-to-sessile transition is an important lifestyle switch in 
      diverse bacteria and is often regulated by the intracellular second messenger
      cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In general, high c-di-GMP
      concentrations promote attachment to surfaces, whereas cells with low levels of
      signal remain motile. In the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, c-di-GMP
      controls attachment and biofilm formation via regulation of a unipolar
      polysaccharide (UPP) adhesin. The levels of c-di-GMP in A. tumefaciens are
      controlled in part by the dual-function diguanylate cyclase-phosphodiesterase
      (DGC-PDE) protein DcpA. In this study, we report that DcpA possesses both
      c-di-GMP synthesizing and degrading activities in heterologous and native genetic
      backgrounds, a binary capability that is unusual among GGDEF-EAL
      domain-containing proteins. DcpA activity is modulated by a pteridine reductase
      called PruA, with DcpA acting as a PDE in the presence of PruA and a DGC in its
      absence. PruA enzymatic activity is required for the control of DcpA and through 
      this control, attachment and biofilm formation. Intracellular pterin analysis
      demonstrates that PruA is responsible for the production of a novel pterin
      species. In addition, the control of DcpA activity also requires PruR, a protein 
      encoded directly upstream of DcpA with a predicted molybdopterin-binding domain. 
      PruR is hypothesized to be a potential signaling intermediate between PruA and
      DcpA through an as-yet-unidentified mechanism. This study provides the first
      prokaryotic example of a pterin-mediated signaling pathway and a new model for
      the regulation of dual-function DGC-PDE proteins. IMPORTANCE: Pathogenic bacteria
      often attach to surfaces and form multicellular communities called biofilms.
      Biofilms are inherently resilient and can be difficult to treat, resisting common
      antimicrobials. Understanding how bacterial cells transition to the biofilm
      lifestyle is essential in developing new therapeutic strategies. We have
      characterized a novel signaling pathway that plays a dominant role in the
      regulation of biofilm formation in the model pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 
      This control pathway involves small metabolites called pterins, well studied in
      eukaryotes, but this is the first example of pterin-dependent signaling in
      bacteria. The described pathway controls levels of an important intracellular
      second messenger (cyclic diguanylate monophosphate) that regulates key bacterial 
      processes such as biofilm formation, motility, and virulence. Pterins control the
      balance of activity for an enzyme that both synthesizes and degrades the second
      messenger. These findings reveal a complex, multistep pathway that modulates this
      enzyme, possibly identifying new targets for antibacterial intervention.

AB  - Here, we report a quick and low-cost method to improve plant transformation using
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This method involves the use of physical wounding,
      ultrasound, and an increase in exposure time to the bacteria. We show how the
      transformation rate increased from 0 to 14% when an ultrasound pulse of 10 s was 
      used in conjunction with 96 h of bacterial exposure in Eclipta alba explants.

AB  - Physical contact between A. tumefaciens and the target plant cell walls is
      essential to transfer and integrate the transgene to introduce a novel trait.
      Chemotaxis response and attachment of Agrobacterium towards Vanda Kasem's Delight
      (VKD) protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) were studied to analyse the interaction
      between Agrobacterium and PLB during the transformation event. The study shows
      that initially A. tumefaciens reversibly attached to PLB surface via polar and
      lateral mode of adherence followed by the irreversible attachment which involved 
      the production of cellulosic fibril by A. tumefaciens. Cellulosic fibril allows
      formation of biofilm at the tip of trichome. Contrarily, attachment mutant
      Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha was significantly deficient in the attachment
      process. Spectrophotometric GUS assay showed the mean value of attachment by A.
      tumefaciens was 8.72 % compared to the negative control E. coli strain DH5alpha
      that produced 0.16 %. A. tumefaciens swarmed with sharper and brighter edge when 
      severe wounding was applied to the PLBs producing the highest swarming ratio of
      1.46 demonstrating the positive effect of the plant exudates on bacterial
      movement. The study shows that VKD's PLBs are the suitable explants for
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation since the bacteria expressed higher
      competency rate.

TI  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti Plasmid Virulence Gene virE2 Reduces Sri Lankan 
      Cassava Mosaic Virus Infection in Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana Plants.
PG  - 2641-53
LID - 10.3390/v7052641 [doi]
AB  - Cassava mosaic disease is a major constraint to cassava cultivation worldwide. In
      India, the disease is caused by Indian cassava mosaic virus (ICMV) and Sri Lankan
      cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV). The Agrobacterium Ti plasmid virulence gene virE2, 
      encoding a nuclear-localized, single-stranded DNA binding protein, was introduced
      into Nicotiana benthamiana to develop tolerance against SLCMV. Leaf discs of
      transgenic N. benthamiana plants, harboring the virE2 gene, complemented a virE2 
      mutation in A. tumefaciens and produced tumours. Three tested virE2 transgenic
      plants displayed reduction in disease symptoms upon agroinoculation with SLCMV
      DNA A and DNA B partial dimers. A pronounced reduction in viral DNA accumulation 
      was observed in all three virE2 transgenic plants. Thus, virE2 is an effective
      candidate gene to develop tolerance against the cassava mosaic disease and
      possibly other DNA virus diseases.

LID - 10.1080/21655979.2015.1052920 [doi]
AB  - In May 2012, the first plant-derived biopharmaceutical protein received full
      regulatory approval for therapeutic use in humans. Although plant-based
      expression systems have many advantages, they can suffer from low expression
      levels and, depending on the species, the presence of potentially toxic secondary
      metabolites. Transient expression mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be
      used to increase product yields but may also increase the concentration of
      secondary metabolites generated by plant defense responses. We have recently
      investigated the sequence of defense responses triggered by A. tumefaciens in
      tobacco plants and considered how these can be modulated by the transient
      expression of type III effectors from Pseudomonas syringae. Here we discuss the
      limitations of this approach, potential solutions and additional issues
      concerning transient expression in plants that should be investigated in greater 
      detail.

AB  - An efficient system for shoot regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation of Brassica oleracea cv. Green Marvel cultivar is described. This 
      study focuses on developing shoot regeneration from hypocotyl explants of
      broccoli cv. Green Marvel using thidiazuron (TDZ), zeatin, and kinetin, the
      optimization of factors affecting Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the
      hypocotyl explants with heat-resistant cDNA, followed by the confirmation of
      transgenicity of the regenerants. High shoot regeneration was observed in
      0.05-0.1 mg dm(-3) TDZ. TDZ at 0.1 mg dm(-3) produced among the highest
      percentage of shoot regeneration (96.67 %) and mean number of shoot formation
      (6.17). The highest percentage (13.33 %) and mean number (0.17) of putative
      transformant production were on hypocotyl explants subjected to preculture on
      shoot regeneration medium (SRM) with 200 microM acetosyringone. On optimization
      of bacterial density and inoculation time, the highest percentage and mean number
      of putative transformant production were on hypocotyl explants inoculated with a 
      bacterial dilution of 1:5 for 30 min. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay
      indicated a transformation efficiency of 8.33 %. The luciferase assay showed
      stable integration of the Arabidopsis thaliana HSP101 (AtHSP101) cDNA in the
      transgenic broccoli regenerants. Three out of five transgenic lines confirmed
      through PCR showed positive hybridization bands of the AtHSP101 cDNA through
      Southern blot analysis. The presence of AtHSP101 transcripts in the three
      transgenic broccoli lines indicated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
      confirmed the expression of the gene. In conclusion, an improved regeneration
      system has been established from hypocotyl explants of broccoli followed by
      successful transformation with AtHSP101 for resistance to high temperature.

PG  - 137-46
AB  - Agrobacterium is a genus of soil bacteria with the ability to transform plant
      cells by a T-DNA-sequence located on the pTi/pRi- plasmid containing a set of
      genes expressed in plant cells. Expression of these genes leads to a
      proliferation of transformed cells, with the subsequent formation of tumors or
      growths of roots and the synthesis of opines--products of the condensation of
      amino acids with ketoacids or sugars used by Agrobacteria as a source of carbon
      and nitrogen. In this review, we systematized the information about most common
      opines in plant--Agrobacterium systems and their biosynthesis and catabolism
      genes, as well as the role of opines in the interaction of pathogenic
      Agrobacterium with plants and with other Agrobacterium strains, including the
      genetic consequences of such interactions.

TI  - The All-Alpha Domains of Coupling Proteins from the Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      VirB/VirD4 and Enterococcus faecalis pCF10-Encoded Type IV Secretion Systems
      Confer Specificity to Binding of Cognate DNA Substrates.
PG  - 2335-49
LID - 10.1128/JB.00189-15 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Bacterial type IV coupling proteins (T4CPs) bind and mediate the
      delivery of DNA substrates through associated type IV secretion systems (T4SSs). 
      T4CPs consist of a transmembrane domain, a conserved nucleotide-binding domain
      (NBD), and a sequence-variable helical bundle called the all-alpha domain (AAD). 
      In the T4CP structural prototype, plasmid R388-encoded TrwB, the NBD assembles as
      a homohexamer resembling RecA and DNA ring helicases, and the AAD, which sits at 
      the channel entrance of the homohexamer, is structurally similar to N-terminal
      domain 1 of recombinase XerD. Here, we defined the contributions of AADs from the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirD4 and Enterococcus faecalis PcfC T4CPs to DNA
      substrate binding. AAD deletions abolished DNA transfer, whereas production of
      the AAD in otherwise wild-type donor strains diminished the transfer of cognate
      but not heterologous substrates. Reciprocal swaps of AADs between PcfC and VirD4 
      abolished the transfer of cognate DNA substrates, although strikingly, the
      VirD4-AADPcfC chimera (VirD4 with the PcfC AAD) supported the transfer of a
      mobilizable plasmid. Purified AADs from both T4CPs bound DNA substrates without
      sequence preference but specifically bound cognate processing proteins required
      for cleavage at origin-of-transfer sequences. The soluble domains of VirD4 and
      PcfC lacking their AADs neither exerted negative dominance in vivo nor
      specifically bound cognate processing proteins in vitro. Our findings support a
      model in which the T4CP AADs contribute to DNA substrate selection through
      binding of associated processing proteins. Furthermore, MOBQ plasmids have
      evolved a docking mechanism that bypasses the AAD substrate discrimination
      checkpoint, which might account for their capacity to promiscuously transfer
      through many different T4SSs. IMPORTANCE: For conjugative transfer of mobile DNA 
      elements, members of the VirD4/TraG/TrwB receptor superfamily bind cognate DNA
      substrates through mechanisms that are largely undefined. Here, we supply genetic
      and biochemical evidence that a helical bundle, designated the all-alpha domain
      (AAD), of T4SS receptors functions as a substrate specificity determinant. We
      show that AADs from two substrate receptors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirD4 and 
      Enterococcus faecalis PcfC, bind DNA without sequence or strand preference but
      specifically bind the cognate relaxases responsible for nicking and piloting the 
      transferred strand through the T4SS. We propose that interactions of receptor
      AADs with DNA-processing factors constitute a basis for selective coupling of
      mobile DNA elements with type IV secretion channels.

AB  - Antimony (Sb) and its compounds are listed by the United States Environmental
      Protection Agency (USEPA, 1979) and the European Union (CEC, 1976) as a priority 
      pollutant. Microbial redox transformations are presumed to be an important part
      of antimony cycling in nature; however, regulation of these processes and the
      enzymology involved are unknown. In this study, comparative proteomics and
      reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of Sb(III)-oxidizing bacterium Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens GW4 revealed an oxidoreductase (anoA) is widely distributed in
      microorganisms, including at least some documented to be able to oxidize Sb(III).
      Deletion of the anoA gene reduced Sb(III) resistance and decreased Sb(III)
      oxidation by approximately 27%, whereas the anoA complemented strain was similar 
      to the wild type GW4 and a GW4 anoA overexpressing strain increased Sb(III)
      oxidation by approximately 34%. Addition of Sb(III) up-regulated anoA expression 
      and cloning anoA to Escherichia coli demonstrated direct transferability of this 
      activity. A His-tag purified AnoA was found to require NADP(+) as cofactor, and
      exhibited a K(m) for Sb(III) of 64 +/- 10 muM and a V(max) of 150 +/- 7 nmol
      min(-1) mg(-1). This study contributes important initial steps toward a
      mechanistic understanding of microbe-antimony interactions and enhances our
      understanding of how microorganisms participate in antimony biogeochemical
      cycling in nature.

TI  - [Meristematic characteristics of tumors initiated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens in
      pea plants].
PG  - 54-62
AB  - It is known that two key groups of plant hormones--auxins and cytokinins--play an
      important role in plant tumor development. The formation of Agrobacterium-induced
      tumors results from the horizontal transfer of bacterial oncogenes involved in
      the biosynthesis of these hormones in the plant genome. The role of
      transcriptional factors in plant tumor development is poorly investigated. It can
      be assumed that tumor development associated with abnormal cell proliferation can
      be controlled by the same set of transcription factors that control normal cell
      proliferation and, in particular, transcription factors that regulate meristem
      activity. In the present study, we analyzed the histological organization and
      distribution of proliferating cells in tumors induced by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens on pea hypocotyls. In addition, the expression of a set of
      meristem-specific genes with Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced tumor development 
      was analyzed. In general, our results indicate that meristematic structures are
      present in A. tumefaciens-induced tumors and that the development of such tumors 
      is associated with increased expression of a key gene regulating the root apical 
      meristem--the WOX5 gene.

PG  - 374-80

AB  - CONTEXT: Asakura-sanshoo (Zanthoxylum piperitum [L.] DC. f. inerme Makino) is an 
      important medicinal plant in East Asia. Transgenic technique could be applied to 
      improve plant traits and analyze gene function. However, there is no report on
      regeneration and genetic transformation in Asakura-sanshoo. AIMS: To establish a 
      regeneration and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation system
      in Asakura-sanshoo, which could be used for cultivar improvement and gene
      function analysis. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The various combinations of
      indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) and naphthalene acetic acid
      (NAA) were explored for the optimal plant regeneration from petiole and stem of
      Asakura-sanshoo. The half-strength woody plant medium (WPM) with different
      concentrations of NAA and IBA was used to induce root. For genetic
      transformation, A. tumefaciens strain EHA-105 harboring the plasmid pBin-Ex-H-ipt
      which carries the isopentenyl transferase (ipt) gene, beta-glucuronidase (GUS)
      gene and kanamycin resistance gene neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) were
      used. The transformation efficiency was detected by the kanamycin resistant
      frequency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Petioles and stems were obtained from the in
      vitro cultured Asakura-sanshoo. The petiole and stem segments were precultured
      for 3 days, and then inflected using the bacterium at the concentration of OD600 
      0.5-0.8 for 10 min, followed by 3 days co-cultivation. Selection of the
      transgenic plants was carried out after 7 days the regeneration using gradient
      kanamycin at 30 mg/L and 50 mg/L, respectively. Successful transformed plants
      were confirmed by GUS histochemical assays, polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
      reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Southern blotting analysis. RESULTS: The 
      highest shoots regeneration was obtained on WPM supplement with 0.5 mg/L BA and
      0.2 mg/L NAA. The optimal rooting medium was half strength macro-element WPM. The
      kanamycin resistant frequency of petiole and stem was 24.66% and 25.93%,
      respectively. Thirty-five shoots in thousands adventitious buds were confirmed
      through GUS histochemical assays, PCR, RT-PCR, and Southern blotting. The
      regeneration shoot per explants elevated 5.85 fold compared with the wild-type
      plants. CONCLUSIONS: Individual transgenic Asakura-sanshoo lines were obtained.
      In this paper, it first revealed the expression of ipt gene significantly
      promoted the adventitious buds induction in Asakura-sanshoo as the same action as
      in other plants.

TI  - Effect of leaf incubation temperature profiles on Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transient expression.
PG  - 783-90
LID - 10.1002/btpr.2077 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression is known to be highly
      dependent on incubation temperature. Compared with early studies that were
      conducted at constant temperature, we examined the effect of variable leaf
      incubation temperature on transient expression. As a model system, synthetic
      endoglucanase (E1) and endoxylanase (Xyn10A) genes were transiently expressed in 
      detached whole sunflower leaves via vacuum infiltration for biofuel applications.
      We found that the kinetics of transient expression strongly depended on timing of
      the temperature change as well as leaf incubation temperature. Surprisingly, we
      found that high incubation temperature (27-30 degrees C) which is suboptimal for 
      T-DNA transfer, significantly enhanced transient expression if the high
      temperature was applied during the late phase (Day 3-6) of leaf incubation
      whereas incubation temperature in a range of 20-25 degrees C for an early phase
      (Day 0-2) resulted in higher production. On the basis of these results, we
      propose that transient expression is governed by both T-DNA transfer and protein 
      synthesis in plant cells that have different temperature dependent kinetics.
      Because the phases were separated in time and had different optimal temperatures,
      we were then able to develop a novel two phase optimization strategy for leaf
      incubation temperature. Applying the time-varying temperature profile, we were
      able to increase the protein accumulation by fivefold compared with the control
      at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. From our knowledge, this is the first 
      report illustrating the effect of variable temperature profiling for improved
      transient expression.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely used as a versatile tool for development of
      stably transformed model plants and crops. However, the development of
      Agrobacterium based transient plant transformation methods attracted substantial 
      attention in recent years. Transient transformation methods offer several
      applications advancing stable transformations such as rapid and scalable
      recombinant protein production and in planta functional genomics studies. Herein,
      we highlight Agrobacterium and plant genetics factors affecting transfer of T-DNA
      from Agrobacterium into the plant cell nucleus and subsequent transient transgene
      expression. We also review recent methods concerning Agrobacterium mediated
      transient transformation of model plants and crops and outline key physical,
      physiological and genetic factors leading to their successful establishment. Of
      interest are especially Agrobacterium based reverse genetics studies in
      economically important crops relying on use of RNA interference (RNAi) or
      virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology. The applications of Agrobacterium
      based transient plant transformation technology in biotech industry are presented
      in thorough detail. These involve production of recombinant proteins
      (plantibodies, vaccines and therapeutics) and effectoromics-assisted breeding of 
      late blight resistance in potato. In addition, we also discuss biotechnological
      potential of recombinant GFP technology and present own examples of successful
      Agrobacterium mediated transient plant transformations.

TI  - Expression of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) single-chain variable
      fragment (scFv) in Spirodela punctata plants transformed with Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 354-61

AB  - Therapeutic antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) have been
      considered effective for some of the autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
      arthritis, Crohn's diseases, and so on. But associated limitations of the current
      therapeutics in terms of cost, availability, and immunogenicity have necessitated
      the need for alternative candidates. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) can
      negate the limitations tagged with the anti-TNFalpha therapeutics to a greater
      extent. In the present study, Spirodela punctata plants were transformed with
      anti-TNFalpha through in planta transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      strain, EHA105. Instead of cefotaxime, garlic extract (1 mg/mL) was used to
      remove the agrobacterial cells after cocultivation. To the best of our knowledge,
      this report shows for the first time the application of plant extracts in
      transgenic plant development. 95% of the plants survived screening under
      hygromycin. ScFv cDNA integration in the plant genomic DNA was confirmed at the
      molecular level by PCR. The transgenic protein expression was followed up to 10
      months. Expression of scFv was confirmed by immunodot blot. Protein expression
      levels of up to 6.3% of total soluble protein were observed. beta-Glucuronidase
      and green fluorescent protein expressions were also detected in the antibiotic
      resistant plants. The paper shows the generation of transgenic Spirodela
      punctuata plants through in planta transformation.

TI  - Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain 32a as a source of lipopeptides for biocontrol 
      of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains.
PG  - 196-207
LID - 10.1111/jam.12797 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: A Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain, designated 32a, was used to identify
      new compounds active against Agrobacterium tumefaciens and to evaluate their
      efficiency to control crown gall on carrot discs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on
      PCR-assays, four gene clusters were shown to direct the synthesis of the cyclic
      lipopeptides surfactin, iturin A, bacillomycin D and fengycin. Mass spectrometry 
      analysis of culture supernatant led to the identification of these secondary
      metabolites, except bacillomycin, with heterogeneous mixture of homologues.
      Antimicrobial assays using lipopeptides-enriched extract showed a strong
      inhibitory activity against several bacterial and fungal strains, including Ag.
      tumefaciens. Biological control assays on carrot discs using both 32a spores and 
      extract resulted in significant protection against crown gall disease, similar to
      that provided by the reference antagonistic strain Agrobacterium rhizogenes
      K1026. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to all active compounds against Ag. tumefaciens
      that are of proteinaceous nature, this work enables for the first time to
      correlate the strong protective effect of B. amyloliquefaciens strain 32a towards
      crown gall disease with the production of a mixture of lipopeptides. SIGNIFICANCE
      AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings could be useful for growers and nursery men
      who are particularly interested in the biocontrol of the crown gall disease.

TI  - Interaction of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence protein VirD2 with
      histones.
PG  - 401-410
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.083410-0 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a Gram-negative soil bacterium that genetically
      transforms plants and, under laboratory conditions, also transforms non-plant
      organisms, such as fungi and yeasts. During the transformation process a piece of
      ssDNA (T-strand) is transferred into the host cells via a type IV secretion
      system. The VirD2 relaxase protein, which is covalently attached at the 5' end of
      the T-strand through Tyr29, mediates nuclear entry as it contains a nuclear
      localization sequence. How the T-strand reaches the chromatin and becomes
      integrated in the chromosomal DNA is still far from clear. Here, we investigated 
      whether VirD2 binds to histone proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
      Using immobilized GFP-VirD2 and in vitro synthesized His6-tagged S. cerevisiae
      proteins, interactions between VirD2 and the histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 were
      revealed. In vivo, these interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence 
      complementation experiments. After co-cultivation of Agrobacterium strains
      expressing VirD2 tagged with a fragment of the yellow fluorescent protein
      analogue Venus with yeast strains expressing histone H2A or H2B tagged with the
      complementary part of Venus, fluorescence was detected in dot-shaped structures
      in the recipient yeast cells. The results indicated that VirD2 was transferred
      from Agrobacterium to yeast cells and that it interacted with histones in the
      host cell, and thus may help direct the T-DNA (transferred DNA) to the chromatin 
      as a prelude to integration into the host chromosomal DNA.

TI  - Structure and function of a decarboxylating Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      keto-deoxy-d-galactarate dehydratase.
PG  - 8052-60
LID - 10.1021/bi501290k [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At) strain C58 contains an oxidative enzyme pathway
      that can function on both d-glucuronic and d-galacturonic acid. The corresponding
      gene coding for At keto-deoxy-d-galactarate (KDG) dehydratase is located in the
      same gene cluster as those coding for uronate dehydrogenase (At Udh) and
      galactarolactone cycloisomerase (At Gci) which we have previously characterized. 
      Here, we present the kinetic characterization and crystal structure of At KDG
      dehydratase, which catalyzes the next step, the decarboxylating hydrolyase
      reaction of KDG to produce alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde (alpha-KGSA) and
      carbon dioxide. The crystal structures of At KDG dehydratase and its complexes
      with pyruvate and 2-oxoadipic acid, two substrate analogues, were determined to
      1.7 A, 1.5 A, and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. Furthermore, mass spectrometry 
      was used to confirm reaction end-products. The results lead us to propose a
      structure-based mechanism for At KDG dehydratase, suggesting that while the
      enzyme belongs to the Class I aldolase protein family, it does not follow a
      typical retro-aldol condensation mechanism.

AB  - Monocotyledonous plants were believed to be not transformable by the soil
      bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens until two decades ago, although convenient
      protocols for infection of leaf disks and subsequent regeneration of transgenic
      plants had been well established in a number of dicotyledonous species by then.
      This belief was reinforced by the fact that monocotyledons are mostly outside the
      host range of crown gall disease caused by the bacterium and by the failures in
      trials in monocotyledons to mimic the transformation protocols for dicotyledons. 
      However, a key reason for the failure could have been the lack of active cell
      divisions at the wound sites in monocotyledons. The complexity and narrow optimal
      windows of critical factors, such as genotypes of plants, conditions of the
      plants from which explants are prepared, tissue culture methods and culture
      media, pre-treatments of explants, strains of A. tumefaciens, inducers of
      virulence genes, transformation vectors, selection marker genes and selective
      agents, kept technical hurdles high. Eventually it was demonstrated that rice and
      maize could be transformed by co-cultivating cells of callus cultures or immature
      embryos, which are actively dividing or about to divide, with A. tumefaciens.
      Subsequently, these initial difficulties were resolved one by one by many
      research groups, and the major cereals are now transformed quite efficiently. As 
      many as 15 independent transgenic events may be regenerated from a single piece
      of immature embryo of rice. Maize transformation protocols are well established, 
      and almost all transgenic events deregulated for commercialization after 2003
      were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Wheat, barley, and
      sorghum are also among those plants that can be efficiently transformed by A.

AB  - Crown gall tumors are formed mainly by actions of a group of genes in the T-DNA
      that is transferred from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and integrated into the
      nuclear DNA of host plants. These genes encode enzymes for biosynthesis of auxin 
      and cytokinin in plant cells. Gene 6b in the T-DNA affects tumor morphology and
      this gene alone is able to induce small tumors on certain plant species. In
      addition, unorganized calli are induced from leaf disks of tobacco that are
      incubated on phytohormone-free media; shooty teratomas, and morphologically
      abnormal plants, which might be due to enhanced competence of cell division and
      meristematic states, are regenerated from the calli. Thus, the 6b gene appears to
      stimulate a reprogramming process in plants. To uncover mechanisms behind this
      process, various approaches including the yeast-two-hybrid system have been
      exploited and histone H3 was identified as one of the proteins that interact with
      6b. It has been also demonstrated that 6b acts as a histone H3 chaperon in vitro 
      and affects the expression of various genes related to cell division competence
      and the maintenance of meristematic states. We discuss current views on a role of
      6b protein in tumorigenesis and reprogramming in plants.

AB  - An antimicrobial peptide was extracted from the antagonistic actinomycetes G19.
      It was designated as G19-F. By using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the molecular
      weight of G19-F was determined. The primary structure of the antimicrobial
      peptide was determined using N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Results
      showed that the peptide had eleven amino acids, with the sequence
      D-V-C-D-G-G-D-G-D-E-D, and a calculated molecular mass of 1,096 Da. G19-F showed 
      antimicrobial activity against peach crown gall caused by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. The antimicrobial peptide maintained its activity after being heated
      to 100 degrees C and exhibited stability from pH 4 to 10. Its activity has also
      remained after ultraviolet irradiation. The mechanism by which G19-F inhibits A. 
      tumefaciens was to increase permeability of the cell membrane and destroy the
      cell wall structure. Furthermore, as a novel peptide, it has a potential for cure
      A. tumefaciens infection.

TI  - Profound impact of Hfq on nutrient acquisition, metabolism and motility in the
      plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e110427
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0110427 [doi]
AB  - As matchmaker between mRNA and sRNA interactions, the RNA chaperone Hfq plays a
      key role in riboregulation of many bacteria. Often, the global influence of Hfq
      on the transcriptome is reflected by substantially altered proteomes and
      pleiotropic phenotypes in hfq mutants. Using quantitative proteomics and
      co-immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-sequencing (RIP-seq) of Hfq-bound RNAs, 
      we demonstrate the pervasive role of Hfq in nutrient acquisition, metabolism and 
      motility of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. 136 of 2544 proteins
      identified by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) were
      affected in the absence of Hfq. Most of them were associated with ABC
      transporters, general metabolism and motility. RIP-seq of chromosomally encoded
      Hfq3xFlag revealed 1697 mRNAs and 209 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) associated with
      Hfq. 56 ncRNAs were previously undescribed. Interestingly, 55% of the Hfq-bound
      ncRNAs were encoded antisense (as) to a protein-coding sequence suggesting that
      A. tumefaciens Hfq plays an important role in asRNA-target interactions. The
      exclusive enrichment of 296 mRNAs and 31 ncRNAs under virulence conditions
      further indicates a role for post-transcriptional regulation in A.
      tumefaciens-mediated plant infection. On the basis of the iTRAQ and RIP-seq data,
      we assembled a comprehensive model of the Hfq core regulon in A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Development of a transformation system for Aspergillus sojae based on the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated approach.
PG  - 247
LID - 10.1186/s12866-014-0247-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspergillus sojae has been an important filamentous fungus in
      Biotechnology due to its use in diverse fermentative processes for the production
      of various food products. Furthermore, this fungus is a common expression system 
      for the production of enzymes and other metabolites. The availability of
      molecular genetic tools to explore its biology is thus of big interest. In this
      study, an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system for A. 
      sojae was developed and its applicability evaluated. RESULTS: The donor plasmid
      named pRM-eGFP was constructed for ATMT of A. sojae. This plasmid contains the
      ble and egfp genes in its transfer DNA element (T-DNA) to confer phleomycin
      resistance and express the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in A. sojae,
      respectively. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404) harboring the donor plasmid and
      A. sojae (ATCC 20235) were co-cultured under diverse conditions to achieve ATMT. 
      The maximum number of transformed fungi was obtained after three days of
      co-culturing at 28 degrees C, and selection with 50 mug/ml phleomycin. Polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence microscopy and Western Blot analysis for EGFP 
      expression confirmed successful genomic integration of the T-DNA element in A.
      sojae. The T-DNA was mitotically stable in approximately 40% of the fungal
      transformants after four generations of sub-culturing under phleomycin pressure. 
      CONCLUSION: We successfully established a new ATMT protocol for A. sojae. This
      transformation system should enable further protein expression studies on this
      filamentous fungus.

AB  - The genetic transformation of certain organisms, required for gene function
      analysis or complementation, is often not very efficient, especially when dealing
      with large gene constructs or genomic fragments. We have adapted the natural DNA 
      transfer mechanism from the soil pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 
      to deliver intact large DNA constructs to basidiomycete fungi of the genus
      Ustilago where they stably integrated into their genome. To this end, Bacterial
      Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones containing large fungal genomic DNA fragments 
      were converted via a Lambda phage-based recombineering step to Agrobacterium
      transfer-competent binary vectors (BIBACs) with a Ustilago-specific selection
      marker. The fungal genomic DNA fragment was subsequently successfully delivered
      as T-DNA through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into Ustilago species
      where an intact copy stably integrated into the genome. By modifying the
      recombineering vector, this method can theoretically be adapted for many
      different fungi.

TI  - Control of zinc homeostasis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens via zur and the zinc
      uptake genes znuABC and zinT.
PG  - 2452-2463
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.082446-0 [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens zinc uptake regulator (Zur) was shown to negatively
      regulate the zinc uptake genes znuABC, encoding a zinc transport system belonging
      to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, and zinT, which encodes a
      periplasmic zinc-binding protein. The expression of znuABC and zinT was inducible
      when cells were grown in medium containing a metal chelator (EDTA), and this
      induction was shown to be specific for zinc depletion. The expression of znuABC
      was reduced in response to increased zinc in a dose-dependent manner, and zinT
      had a less pronounced but similar pattern of zinc-regulated expression. The
      inactivation of zur led to constitutively high expression of znuABC and zinT. In 
      addition, a zur mutant had an increased total zinc content compared to the WT
      NTL4 strain, whereas the inactivation of zinT caused a reduction in the total
      zinc content. The zinT gene is shown to play a dominant role and to be more
      important than znuA and znuB for A. tumefaciens survival under zinc deprivation. 
      ZinT can function even when ZnuABC is inactivated. However, mutations in zur,
      znuA, znuB or zinT did not affect the virulence of A. tumefaciens.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers DNA and proteins to a plant cell through a
      type IV secretion apparatus assembled by the VirB proteins. All VirB proteins
      localized to a cell pole, although these conclusions are in dispute. To study
      subcellular location of the VirB proteins and to identify determinants of their
      subcellular location, we tagged two proteins, VirB4 and VirB11, with the visual
      marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) and studied localization of the fusion
      proteins by epifluorescence microscopy. Both GFP-VirB4 and GFP-VirB11 fusions
      localized to a single cell pole. GFP-VirB11 was also functional in DNA transfer. 
      To identify the polar localization domains (PLDs) of VirB4 and VirB11, we
      analyzed fusions of GFP with smaller segments of the two proteins. Two
      noncontiguous regions in VirB4, residues 236-470 and 592-789, contain PLDs. The
      VirB11 PLD mapped to a 69 amino acid segment, residues 149-217, in the central
      region of the protein. These domains are probably involved in interactions that
      target the two proteins to a cell pole.

TI  - Synthesis of methylerythritol phosphate analogues and their evaluation as

AB  - The methylerythritol phosphate biosynthetic pathway, found in most Bacteria, some
      parasitic protists, and plant chloroplasts, converts D-glyceraldehyde phosphate
      and pyruvate to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate
      (DMAPP), where it intersects with the mevalonate pathway found in some Bacteria, 
      Archaea, and Eukarya, including the cytosol of plants.
      D-3-Methylerythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), the first pathway-specific intermediate
      in the pathway, is converted to IPP and DMAPP by the consecutive action of the
      IspD-H proteins. We synthesized five D-MEP analogues-D-erythritol-4-phosphate
      (EP), D-3-methylthrietol-4-phosphate (MTP), D-3-ethylerythritol-4-phosphate
      (EEP), D-1-amino-3-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (NMEP), and
      D-3-methylerythritol-4-thiolophosphate (MESP)-and studied their ability to
      function as alternative substrates for the reactions catalyzed by the IspDF
      fusion and IspE proteins from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which covert MEP to the 
      corresponding eight-membered cyclic diphosphate. All of the analogues, except
      MTP, and their products were substrates for the three consecutive enzymes.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transient expression of plant cell
      wall-degrading enzymes in detached sunflower leaves.
PG  - 905-15
AB  - For biofuel applications, synthetic endoglucanase E1 and xylanase (Xyn10A)
      derived from Acidothermus cellulolyticus were transiently expressed in detached
      whole sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) leaves using vacuum infiltration. Three
      different expression systems were tested, including the constitutive CaMV
      35S-driven, CMVar (Cucumber mosaic virus advanced replicating), and TRBO (Tobacco
      mosaic virus RNA-Based Overexpression Vector) systems. For 6-day leaf
      incubations, codon-optimized E1 and xylanase driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were
      successfully expressed in sunflower leaves. The two viral expression vectors,
      CMVar and TRBO, were not successful although we found high expression in
      Nicotiana benthamiana leaves previously for other recombinant proteins. To
      further enhance transient expression, we demonstrated two novel methods: using
      the plant hormone methyl jasmonic acid in the agroinfiltration buffer and
      two-phase optimization of the leaf incubation temperature. When methyl jasmonic
      acid was added to Agrobacterium tumefaciens cell suspensions and infiltrated into
      plant leaves, the functional enzyme production increased 4.6-fold. Production
      also increased up to 4.2-fold when the leaf incubation temperature was elevated
      above the typical temperature, 20C, to 30C in the late incubation phase,
      presumably due to enhanced rate of protein synthesis in plant cells. Finally, we 
      demonstrated co-expression of E1 and xylanase in detached sunflower leaves. To
      our knowledge, this is the first report of (co)expression of heterologous plant
      cell wall-degrading enzymes in sunflower.

TI  - Overexpression of the HspL Promotes Agrobacterium tumefaciens Virulence in
      Arabidopsis Under Heat Shock Conditions.
PG  - 160-8
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-05-14-0133-R [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers a specific DNA fragment from the resident
      tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid and effector virulence (Vir) proteins to plant cells 
      during infection. A. tumefaciens VirB1-11 and VirD4 proteins assemble as the type
      IV secretion system (T4SS), which mediates transfer of the T-DNA and effector Vir
      protein into plant cells, thus resulting in crown gall disease in plants.
      Previous studies revealed that an alpha-crystallin-type, small heat-shock protein
      (HspL) is a more effective VirB8 chaperone than three other small heat-shock
      proteins (HspC, HspAT1, and HspAT2). Additionally, HspL contributes to efficient 
      T4SS-mediated DNA transfer and tumorigenesis under room-temperature growth. In
      this study, we aimed to characterize the impact of HspL on Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation efficiency under heat-shock treatment. During heat shock,
      transient transformation efficiency and VirB8 protein accumulation were lower in 
      the hspL deletion mutant than in the wild type. Overexpression of HspL in A.
      tumefaciens enhanced the transient transformation efficiency in root explants of 
      both susceptible and recalcitrant Arabidopsis ecotypes. In addition, the reduced 
      transient transformation efficiency during heat stress was recovered by
      overexpression of HspL in A. tumefaciens. HspL may help maintain VirB8
      homeostasis and elevate Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency under
      both heat-shock and nonheat-shock growth.

AB  - The plant tumor disease known as crown gall was not called by that name until
      more recent times. Galls on plants were described by Malpighi (1679) who believed
      that these extraordinary growth are spontaneously produced. Agrobacterium was
      first isolated from tumors in 1897 by Fridiano Cavara in Napoli, Italy. After
      this bacterium was recognized to be the cause of crown gall disease, questions
      were raised on the mechanism by which it caused tumors on a variety of plants.
      Numerous very detailed studies led to the identification of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens as the causal bacterium that cleverly transferred a genetic principle
      to plant host cells and integrated it into their chromosomes. Such studies have
      led to a variety of sophisticated mechanisms used by this organism to aid in its 
      survival against competing microorganisms. Knowledge gained from these
      fundamental discoveries has opened many avenues for researchers to examine their 
      primary organisms of study for similar mechanisms of pathogenesis in both plants 
      and animals. These discoveries also advanced the genetic engineering of
      domesticated plants for improved food and fiber.

AB  - The construction of high-level protein expression vectors using the CaMV 35S
      promoter in concert with highly efficient translation initiation signals for
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a relatively less explored field compared to that of
      Escherichia coli. In the current study, we experimentally investigated the
      capacity of the CaMV 35S promoter to direct GFP gene expression in A. tumefaciens
      in the context of different viral and chloroplastic translation initiation
      signals. GFP expression and concomitant translational efficiency was monitored by
      confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. Among all of the constructs, the
      highest level of translation was observed for the construct containing the phage 
      T7 translation initiation region followed by the chloroplastic Rubisco Large
      Subunit (rbcL) 58-nucleotide 5' leader region including its SD-like sequence
      (GGGAGGG). Replacing the SD-like (GGGAGGG) with non SD-like (TTTATTT) or
      replacing the remaining 52 nucleotides of rbcL with nonspecific sequence
      completely abolished translation. In addition, this 58 nucleotide region of rbcL 
      serves as a translational enhancer in plants when located within the 5' UTR of
      mRNA corresponding to GFP. Other constructs, including those containing sequences
      upstream of the coat proteins of Alfalfa Mosaic Virus, or the GAGG sequence of T4
      phage or the chloroplastic atpI and/or PsbA 5' UTR sequence, supported low levels
      of GFP expression or none at all. From these studies, we propose that we have
      created high expression vectors in A. tumefaciens and/or plants which contain the
      CaMV 35S promoter, followed by the translationally strong T7 SD plus RBS
      translation initiation region or the rbcL 58-nucleotide 5' leader region upstream
      of the gene of interest.

AB  - Lecanicillium lecanii has been used in the biological control of several insects 
      in agricultural practice. Since the gene manipulation tools for this
      entomopathogenic fungus have not been sufficiently developed, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) in L. lecanii was investigated in this
      study, using the wild-type isolate FZ9906 as a progenitor strain and the
      hygromycin B resistance (hph) gene as a selection marker. Furthermore, a field
      carbendazim-resistant (mrt) gene from Botrytis cinerea was expressed in L.
      lecanii FZ9906 via the ATMT system. The results revealed that the frequency of
      transformation surpassed 25transformants/10(6) conidia, most of the putative
      transformants contained a single copy of T-DNA, and the T-DNA inserts were stably
      inherited after five generations. All putative transformants had
      indistinguishable biological characteristics relative to the wild-type strain,
      excepting two transformants with altered growth habits or virulence. Moreover,
      the resistance of the putative transformants to carbendazim (MBC) was improved,
      and the highest one was 380-fold higher than the wild-type strain. In conclusion,
      ATMT is an effective and suitable system for L. lecanii transformation, and will 
      be a useful tool for the basic and application research of gene functions and
      gene modifications of this strain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Based on the system of regeneration,the genetic transformation system 
      of Lonicera macranthoides was established. METHODS: Tissue culture method of
      seedlings, Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation method of explants, 
      report gene was detected by gus staining and PCR. RESULTS: The efficient
      transformation time was 8 minutes of infection. The good transformation rate was 
      gained with the kanamycin 35 mg/L and cefotaxime 600 mg/L. The concentration of
      kanamycin had a leading effect on bud differentiation between two antibiotics,
      and bud induction rate reached extremely significant difference. Results of gus
      staining and PCR proved that the gus gene was integrated into Lonicera
      macranthoides genome. CONCLUSION: The genetic transformation system of Lonicera
      macranthoides leaves mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHAlO5 was established
      for the first time.

AB  - The success of Agrobacterium mediated plant transformation depends to a certain
      extent on appropriate selection of the A. tumefaciens strain for a particular
      plant species. Many stages in a plant transformation procedure are prone to
      bacterial contamination with similar antibiotic resistance that may compromise
      the identity of the A. tumefaciens strain used, in turn adversely affecting
      success of a transformation experiment. Different primer sets were designed to
      exploit genetic differences among different strains of A. tumefaciens which are
      commonly used for plant genetic transformation, to identity confirmation as well 
      as to distinguish them from one another. The primer sets Ach5FtsZ-F/R specific
      for Ach5 and C58GlyA-F/R specific for C58 were designed on chromosomal DNA while 
      primer sets pTiBo542-F/R and nptI-F/R specific for plasmid pTiBo542 are capable
      to identify and distinguish these strains from one another. These primer sets
      when used simultaneously in multiplex PCR, produce a pattern which uniquely
      identifies all these strains and distinguishes them except for GV3101 and C58C1, 
      which can further be distinguished from each other by rifampicin screening. The
      multiplex PCR assay and primers being reported here serve as a valuable tool in
      determining the identity of A. tumefaciens strains at any stage of plant
      transformation procedure.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens responses to plant-derived signaling molecules.
PG  - 322
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00322 [doi]
AB  - As a special phytopathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects a wide range of
      plant hosts and causes plant tumors also known as crown galls. The complexity of 
      Agrobacterium-plant interaction has been studied for several decades.
      Agrobacterium pathogenicity is largely attributed to its evolved capabilities of 
      precise recognition and response to plant-derived chemical signals. Agrobacterium
      perceives plant-derived signals to activate its virulence genes, which are
      responsible for transferring and integrating its Transferred DNA (T-DNA) from its
      Tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid into the plant nucleus. The expression of T-DNA in
      plant hosts leads to the production of a large amount of indole-3-acetic acid
      (IAA), cytokinin (CK), and opines. IAA and CK stimulate plant growth, resulting
      in tumor formation. Agrobacterium utilizes opines as nutrient sources as well as 
      signals in order to activate its quorum sensing (QS) to further promote virulence
      and opine metabolism. Intriguingly, Agrobacterium also recognizes plant-derived
      signals including gamma-amino butyric acid and salicylic acid (SA) to activate
      quorum quenching that reduces the level of QS signals, thereby avoiding the
      elicitation of plant defense and preserving energy. In addition, Agrobacterium
      hijacks plant-derived signals including SA, IAA, and ethylene to down-regulate
      its virulence genes located on the Ti plasmid. Moreover, certain metabolites from
      corn (Zea mays) also inhibit the expression of Agrobacterium virulence genes.
      Here we outline the responses of Agrobacterium to major plant-derived signals
      that impact Agrobacterium-plant interactions.

TI  - 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase catalyzes a central step of nicotine
      degradation in Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33.
PG  - e103324
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0103324 [doi]
AB  - Nicotine is a main alkaloid in tobacco and is also the primary toxic compound in 
      tobacco wastes. It can be degraded by bacteria via either pyridine pathway or
      pyrrolidine pathway. Previously, a fused pathway of the pyridine pathway and the 
      pyrrolidine pathway was proposed for nicotine degradation by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens S33, in which 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP) is a key
      intermediate connecting the two pathways. We report here the purification and
      properties of an NADH-dependent HSP hydroxylase from A. tumefaciens S33. The
      90-kDa homodimeric flavoprotein catalyzed the oxidative decarboxylation of HSP to
      2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5-DHP) in the presence of NADH and FAD at pH 8.0 at a
      specific rate of about 18.8 +/- 1.85 micromol min-1 mg protein-1. Its gene was
      identified by searching the N-terminal amino acid residues of the purified
      protein against the genome draft of the bacterium. It encodes a protein composed 
      of 391 amino acids with 62% identity to HSP hydroxylase (HspB) from Pseudomonas
      putida S16, which degrades nicotine via the pyrrolidine pathway. Considering the 
      application potential of 2,5-DHP in agriculture and medicine, we developed a
      route to transform HSP into 2,5-DHP with recombinant HSP hydroxylase and an
      NADH-regenerating system (formate, NAD+ and formate dehydrogenase), via which
      around 0.53 +/- 0.03 mM 2,5-DHP was produced from 0.76 +/- 0.01 mM HSP with a
      molar conversion as 69.7%. This study presents the biochemical properties of the 
      key enzyme HSP hydroxylase which is involved in the fused nicotine degradation
      pathway of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways and a new green route to
      biochemically synthesize functionalized 2,5-DHP.

TI  - Genetic transformation of Fusarium avenaceum by Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      mediated transformation and the development of a USER-Brick vector construction
      system.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-15-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The plant pathogenic and saprophytic fungus Fusarium avenaceum causes
      considerable in-field and post-field losses worldwide due to its infections of a 
      wide range of different crops. Despite its significant impact on the
      profitability of agriculture production and a desire to characterize the
      infection process at the molecular biological level, no genetic transformation
      protocol has yet been established for F. avenaceum. In the current study, it is
      shown that F. avenaceum can be efficiently transformed by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens mediated transformation. In addition, an efficient and versatile
      single step vector construction strategy relying on Uracil Specific Excision
      Reagent (USER) Fusion cloning, is developed. RESULTS: The new vector construction
      system, termed USER-Brick, is based on a limited number of PCR amplified vector
      fragments (core USER-Bricks) which are combined with PCR generated fragments from
      the gene of interest. The system was found to have an assembly efficiency of 97% 
      with up to six DNA fragments, based on the construction of 55 vectors targeting
      different polyketide synthase (PKS) and PKS associated transcription factor
      encoding genes in F. avenaceum. Subsequently, the DeltaFaPKS3 vector was used for
      optimizing A. tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT) of F. avenaceum with
      respect to six variables. Acetosyringone concentration, co-culturing time,
      co-culturing temperature and fungal inoculum were found to significantly impact
      the transformation frequency. Following optimization, an average of 140
      transformants per 106 macroconidia was obtained in experiments aimed at
      introducing targeted genome modifications. Targeted deletion of FaPKS6
      (FA08709.2) in F. avenaceum showed that this gene is essential for biosynthesis
      of the polyketide/nonribosomal compound fusaristatin A. CONCLUSION: The new
      USER-Brick system is highly versatile by allowing for the reuse of a common set
      of building blocks to accommodate seven different types of genome modifications. 
      New USER-Bricks with additional functionality can easily be added to the system
      by future users. The optimized protocol for ATMT of F. avenaceum represents the
      first reported targeted genome modification by double homologous recombination of
      this plant pathogen and will allow for future characterization of this fungus.
      Functional linkage of FaPKS6 to the production of the mycotoxin fusaristatin A
      serves as a first testimony to this.

TI  - The multifaceted roles of the interspecies signalling molecule indole in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1234-44
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.12560 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria utilize signal molecules to ensure their survival in environmental
      niches, and indole is an interspecies and interkingdom signalling molecule, which
      is widespread in the natural environment. In this study, we sought to identify
      novel roles of indole in soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens was found not to synthesize indole and to degrade it
      rapidly. The addition of exogenous indole dose-dependently inhibited A.
      tumefaciens growth and decreased its motility. Surprisingly, indole markedly
      increased A. tumefaciens biofilm formation on polystyrene, glass and nylon
      membrane surfaces and enhanced its antibiotic tolerance. Transcriptional analysis
      showed that indole markedly up-regulated several biofilm-related (celA, cheA,
      exoR, phoB, flgE, fliR and motA), stress-related genes (clpB, dnaK, gsp, gyrB,
      marR and soxR) and efflux genes (emrA, norM, and Atu2551) in A. tumefaciens,
      which partially explained the increased biofilm formation and antibiotic
      tolerance. In contrast, the plant auxin indole-3-acetic acid did not affect
      biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance or gene expression. Interestingly, indole
      was found to exhibit several similarities with antibiotics, as it inhibited the
      growth of non-indole-producing bacteria, whereas these bacteria countered its
      effects by rapidly degrading indole, and by enhancing biofilm formation and
      antibiotic tolerance.

PG  - 8629-39

AB  - Isochrysis galbana and Isochrysis sp. are economically important microalgae from 
      the division of haptophytes. Here, we report Agrobacterium-mediated stable DNA
      transfer into their nuclear genomes. Initial studies were performed to
      standardize co-cultivation media and determine the sensitivity of the microalgae 
      to selective agents. Up to 1 mg/ml of the antibiotic hygromycin did not inhibit
      growth, whereas both the haptophytes bleached in artificial seawater (ASW) medium
      containing micromolar concentrations of the herbicide norflurazon. Co-cultivation
      of Isochrysis sp. and I. galbana with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA 4404
      harboring the binary vector pCAMBIA 1380-pds-L504R yielded norflurazon-resistant 
      (NR) colonies visible on selective plates after 20-30 days. pCAMBIA
      1380-pds-L540R was constructed by cloning a mutated genomic phytoene desaturase
      (pds) gene from Haematococcus pluvialis as a selectable marker gene into the
      binary vector system pCAMBIA 1380. Co-cultivation of Isochrysis sp. with A.
      tumefaciens in ASW medium containing 200 muM of acetosyringone for 72 h produced 
      the highest number of NR cells. For I. galbana, 100 muM of acetosyringone, ASW
      medium, and 48 h co-cultivation period appeared to be optimum co-cultivation
      parameters. The NR colonies kept their resistance phenotype for at least 24
      months, even in the absence of selective pressure. The transfer of the pds gene
      in NR cells was shown by PCR amplification of the T-DNA sequences from the
      genomic DNA of NR cells and Southern blot analysis using T-DNA sequences as
      probes. The genetic manipulation described here will allow metabolic engineering 
      and a better understanding of several biochemical pathways in the future.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens exoR controls acid response genes and impacts
      exopolysaccharide synthesis, horizontal gene transfer, and virulence gene
      expression.
PG  - 3221-33
LID - 10.1128/JB.01751-14 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a facultative plant pathogen and the causative agent
      of crown gall disease. The initial stage of infection involves attachment to
      plant tissues, and subsequently, biofilms may form at these sites. This study
      focuses on the periplasmic ExoR regulator, which was identified based on the
      severe biofilm deficiency of A. tumefaciens exoR mutants. Genome-wide expression 
      analysis was performed to elucidate the complete ExoR regulon. Overproduction of 
      the exopolysaccharide succinoglycan is a dramatic phenotype of exoR mutants.
      Comparative expression analyses revealed that the core ExoR regulon is unaffected
      by succinoglycan synthesis. Several findings are consistent with previous
      observations: genes involved in succinoglycan biosynthesis, motility, and type VI
      secretion are differentially expressed in the DeltaexoR mutant. In addition,
      these studies revealed new functional categories regulated by ExoR, including
      genes related to virulence, conjugation of the pAtC58 megaplasmid, ABC
      transporters, and cell envelope architecture. To address how ExoR exerts a broad 
      impact on gene expression from its periplasmic location, a genetic screen was
      performed to isolate suppressor mutants that mitigate the exoR motility phenotype
      and identify downstream components of the ExoR regulatory pathway. This
      suppression analysis identified the acid-sensing two-component system ChvG-ChvI, 
      and the suppressor mutant phenotypes suggest that all or most of the
      characteristic exoR properties are mediated through ChvG-ChvI. Subsequent
      analysis indicates that exoR mutants are simulating a response to acidic
      conditions, even in neutral media. This work expands the model for ExoR
      regulation in A. tumefaciens and underscores the global role that this regulator 
      plays on gene expression.

AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread molecular weapon deployed by 
      many Proteobacteria to target effectors/toxins into both eukaryotic and
      prokaryotic cells. We report that Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil bacterium
      that triggers tumorigenesis in plants, produces a family of type VI DNase
      effectors (Tde) that are distinct from previously known polymorphic toxins and
      nucleases. Tde exhibits an antibacterial DNase activity that relies on a
      conserved HxxD motif and can be counteracted by a cognate immunity protein, Tdi. 
      In vitro, A. tumefaciens T6SS could kill Escherichia coli but triggered a lethal 
      counterattack by Pseudomonas aeruginosa upon injection of the Tde toxins.
      However, in an in planta coinfection assay, A. tumefaciens used Tde effectors to 
      attack both siblings cells and P. aeruginosa to ultimately gain a competitive
      advantage. Such acquired T6SS-dependent fitness in vivo and conservation of
      Tde-Tdi couples in bacteria highlights a widespread antibacterial weapon
      beneficial for niche colonization.

TI  - GxySBA ABC transporter of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and its role in sugar
      utilization and vir gene expression.
PG  - 3150-9
LID - 10.1128/JB.01648-14 [doi]
AB  - Monosaccharides available in the extracellular milieu of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens can be transported into the cytoplasm, or via the periplasmic sugar
      binding protein, ChvE, play a critical role in controlling virulence gene
      expression. The ChvE-MmsAB ABC transporter is involved in the utilization of a
      wide range of monosaccharide substrates but redundant transporters are likely
      given the ability of a chvE-mmsAB deletion strain to grow, albeit more slowly, in
      the presence of particular monosaccharides. In this study, a putative ABC
      transporter encoded by the gxySBA operon is identified and shown to be involved
      in the utilization of glucose, xylose, fucose, and arabinose, which are also
      substrates for the ChvE-MmsAB ABC transporter. Significantly, GxySBA is also
      shown to be the first characterized glucosamine ABC transporter. The divergently 
      transcribed gene gxyR encodes a repressor of the gxySBA operon, the function of
      which can be relieved by a subset of the transported sugars, including glucose,
      xylose, and glucosamine, and this substrate-induced expression can be repressed
      by glycerol. Furthermore, deletion of the transporter can increase the
      sensitivity of the virulence gene expression system to certain sugars that
      regulate it. Collectively, the results reveal a remarkably diverse set of
      substrates for the GxySBA transporter and its contribution to the repression of
      sugar sensitivity by the virulence-controlling system, thereby facilitating the
      capacity of the bacterium to distinguish between the soil and plant environments.

TI  - Integrative gene transfer in the truffle Tuber borchii by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s13568-014-0043-x [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation is a powerful tool for reverse 
      genetics and functional genomic analysis in a wide variety of plants and fungi.
      Tuber spp. are ecologically important and gastronomically prized fungi
      ("truffles") with a cryptic life cycle, a subterranean habitat and a symbiotic,
      but also facultative saprophytic lifestyle. The genome of a representative member
      of this group of fungi has recently been sequenced. However, because of their
      poor genetic tractability, including transformation, truffles have so far eluded 
      in-depth functional genomic investigations. Here we report that A. tumefaciens
      can infect Tuber borchii mycelia, thereby conveying its transfer DNA with the
      production of stably integrated transformants. We constructed two new binary
      plasmids (pABr1 and pABr3) and tested them as improved transformation vectors
      using the green fluorescent protein as reporter gene and hygromycin
      phosphotransferase as selection marker. Transformants were stable for at least 12
      months of in vitro culture propagation and, as revealed by TAIL- PCR analysis,
      integration sites appear to be heterogeneous, with a preference for repeat
      element-containing genome sites.

TI  - Evolution of enzymatic activities in the enolase superfamily: galactarate
      dehydratase III from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
PG  - 4192-203
LID - 10.1021/bi5005377 [doi]
AB  - The genome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 encodes 12 members of the enolase
      superfamily (ENS), eight of which are members of the mandelate racemase (MR)
      subgroup and, therefore, likely to be acid sugar dehydratases. Using a library of
      77 acid sugars for high-throughput screening, one protein (UniProt entry A9CG74; 
      locus tag Atu4196) showed activity with both m-galactarate and d-galacturonate.
      Two families of galactarate dehydratases had been discovered previously in the
      ENS, GalrD/TalrD [Yew, W. S., et al. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 9564-9577] and
      GalrD-II [Rakus, J. F., et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 11546-11558]; these have
      different active site acid/base catalysis and have no activity with
      d-galacturonate. A9CG74 dehydrates m-galactarate to form
      2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate but does not dehydrate d-galacturonate as expected.
      Instead, when A9CG74 is incubated with d-galacturonate, 3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate
      or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate is formed. In this reaction, instead of abstracting
      the C5 proton alpha to the carboxylate group, the expected reaction for a member 
      of the ENS, the enzyme apparently abstracts the proton alpha to the aldehyde
      group to form 3-deoxy-d-threo-hexulosuronate that undergoes a 1,2-hydride shift
      similar to the benzylic acid rearrangement to form the observed product. A.
      tumefaciens C58 does not utilize m-galactarate as a carbon source under the
      conditions tested in this study, although it does utilize d-galacturonate, which 
      is a likely precursor to m-galactarate. The gene encoding A9CG74 and several
      genome proximal genes were upregulated with d-galacturonate as the carbon source.
      One of these, a member of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase superfamily, catalyzes
      the dehydration and subsequent decarboxylation of 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-galactarate to
      alpha-ketoglutarate semialdehyde, thereby providing a pathway for the conversion 
      of m-galactarate to alpha-ketoglutarate semialdehyde.

TI  - Gene targeting using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated CRISPR-Cas system in 
      rice.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s12284-014-0005-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic
      repeat (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is a novel molecular
      tool for site-specific genome modification. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was recently
      introduced into plants by transient or stable transformation. FINDINGS: Here, we 
      report gene targeting in rice via the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      CRISPR-Cas9 system. Three 20-nt CRISPR RNAs were designed to pair with diverse
      sites followed by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of the rice herbicide
      resistance gene BEL. After integrating the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9
      cassette in a single binary vector, transgenic rice plants harboring sgRNA:Cas9
      were generated by A. tumefaciens-mediated stable transformation. By analyzing the
      targeting site on the genome of corresponding transgenic plants, the mutations
      were determined. The mutagenesis efficiency was varied from ~2% to ~16%.
      Furthermore, phenotypic analysis revealed that the biallelic mutated transgenic
      plant was sensitive to bentazon. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the
      agricultural trait could be purposely modified by sgRNA:Cas9-induced gene
      targeting. CRISPR-Cas9 system could be exploited as a powerful tool for trait
      improvements in crop breeding.

TI  - The Ctp type IVb pilus locus of Agrobacterium tumefaciens directs formation of
      the common pili and contributes to reversible surface attachment.
PG  - 2979-88
LID - 10.1128/JB.01670-14 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens can adhere to plant tissues and abiotic surfaces and
      forms biofilms. Cell surface appendages called pili play an important role in
      adhesion and biofilm formation in diverse bacterial systems. The A. tumefaciens
      C58 genome sequence revealed the presence of the ctpABCDEFGHI genes (cluster of
      type IV pili; Atu0216 to Atu0224), homologous to tad-type pilus systems from
      several bacteria, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Caulobacter
      crescentus. These systems fall into the type IVb pilus group, which can function 
      in bacterial adhesion. Transmission electron microscopy of A. tumefaciens
      revealed the presence of filaments, significantly thinner than flagella and often
      bundled, associated with cell surfaces and shed into the external milieu.
      In-frame deletion mutations of all of the ctp genes, with the exception of ctpF, 
      resulted in nonpiliated derivatives. Mutations in ctpA (a pilin homologue), ctpB,
      and ctpG decreased early attachment and biofilm formation. The adherence of the
      ctpA mutant could be restored by ectopic expression of the paralogous pilA gene. 
      The DeltactpA DeltapilA double pilin mutant displayed a diminished biovolume and 
      lower biofilm height than the wild type under flowing conditions. Surprisingly,
      however, the ctpCD, ctpE, ctpF, ctpH, and ctpI mutants formed normal biofilms and
      showed enhanced reversible attachment. In-frame deletion of the ctpA pilin gene
      in the ctpCD, ctpE, ctpF, ctpH, and ctpI mutants caused the same
      attachment-deficient phenotype as the ctpA single mutant. Collectively, these
      findings indicate that the ctp locus is involved in pilus assembly and that
      nonpiliated mutants, which retain the CtpA pilin, are proficient in attachment
      and adherence.

TI  - Incidence of Agrobacterium tumefaciens Biovar 1 in and on 'Paradox' (Juglans

LID - 10.1094/PDIS-07-13-0742-RE [doi]
AB  - The walnut rootstock 'Paradox' (Juglans hindsii x J. regia) is susceptible to
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which often results in a high incidence of crown gall 
      in nursery or walnut production orchards. Though A. tumefaciens is susceptible to
      the commonly used preplant soil fumigants, crown gall incidence can rise above
      acceptable levels. We examined the ability of Paradox seed to acquire A.
      tumefaciens as a function of harvest method used prior to planting. Over a 2-year
      period at two participating commercial nurseries, Paradox seed were collected
      directly from the mother tree without contacting the soil or gathered after
      sitting on the orchard floor for up to 28 days. A. tumefaciens was never detected
      in or on the 2,650 seeds collected directly from the mother tree. Both virulent
      and avirulent A. tumefaciens strains were detected in and on the husk of nuts
      incubated on the orchard floor at a frequency directly proportional to the time
      spent on the orchard floor. Regardless of A. tumefaciens contamination in or on
      the husk, A. tumefaciens was never detected in the seed interior. Avoiding
      soilborne populations of A. tumefaciens at the time of seed collection will play 
      an important role in managing crown gall.

TI  - Peptidoglycan synthesis machinery in Agrobacterium tumefaciens during unipolar
      growth and cell division.
PG  - e01219-14
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01219-14 [doi]
LID - e01219-14 [pii]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The synthesis of peptidoglycan (PG) in bacteria is a crucial process 
      controlling cell shape and vitality. In contrast to bacteria such as Escherichia 
      coli that grow by dispersed lateral insertion of PG, little is known of the
      processes that direct polar PG synthesis in other bacteria such as the
      Rhizobiales. To better understand polar growth in the Rhizobiales Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, we first surveyed its genome to identify homologs of (~70)
      well-known PG synthesis components. Since most of the canonical cell elongation
      components are absent from A. tumefaciens, we made fluorescent protein fusions to
      other putative PG synthesis components to assay their subcellular localization
      patterns. The cell division scaffolds FtsZ and FtsA, PBP1a, and a Rhizobiales-
      and Rhodobacterales-specific l,d-transpeptidase (LDT) all associate with the
      elongating cell pole. All four proteins also localize to the septum during cell
      division. Examination of the dimensions of growing cells revealed that new cell
      compartments gradually increase in width as they grow in length. This increase in
      cell width is coincident with an expanded region of LDT-mediated PG synthesis
      activity, as measured directly through incorporation of exogenous d-amino acids. 
      Thus, unipolar growth in the Rhizobiales is surprisingly dynamic and represents a
      significant departure from the canonical growth mechanism of E. coli and other
      well-studied bacilli. IMPORTANCE: Many rod-shaped bacteria, including pathogens
      such as Brucella and Mycobacteriu, grow by adding new material to their cell
      poles, and yet the proteins and mechanisms contributing to this process are not
      yet well defined. The polarly growing plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      was used as a model bacterium to explore these polar growth mechanisms. The
      results obtained indicate that polar growth in this organism is facilitated by
      repurposed cell division components and an otherwise obscure class of alternative
      peptidoglycan transpeptidases (l,d-transpeptidases). This growth results in
      dynamically changing cell widths as the poles expand to maturity and contrasts
      with the tightly regulated cell widths characteristic of canonical rod-shaped
      growth. Furthermore, the abundance and/or activity of l,d-transpeptidases appears
      to associate with polar growth strategies, suggesting that these enzymes may
      serve as attractive targets for specifically inhibiting growth of Rhizobiales,
      Actinomycetales, and other polarly growing bacterial pathogens.

      steps of pathogenesis.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00195 [doi]
AB  - Histidine kinases serve as critical environmental sensing modules, and despite
      their designation as simple two-component modules, their functional roles are
      remarkably diverse. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens pathogenesis, VirA serves with
      VirG as the initiating sensor/transcriptional activator for inter-kingdom gene
      transfer and transformation of higher plants. Through responses to three separate
      signal inputs, low pH, sugars, and phenols, A. tumefaciens commits to
      pathogenesis in virtually all flowering plants. However, how these three signals 
      are integrated to regulate the response and why these signals might be diagnostic
      for susceptible cells across such a broad host-range remains poorly understood.
      Using a homology model of the VirA linker region, we provide evidence for
      coordinated long-range transmission of inputs perceived both outside and inside
      the cell through the creation of targeted VirA truncations. Further, our evidence
      is consistent with signal inputs weakening associations between VirA domains to
      position the active site histidine for phosphate transfer. This mechanism
      requires long-range regulation of inter-domain stability and the transmission of 
      input signals through a common integrating domain for VirA signal transduction.

TI  - Plant responses to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and crown gall development.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00155 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease on various plant species by
      introducing its T-DNA into the genome. Therefore, Agrobacterium has been
      extensively studied both as a pathogen and an important biotechnological tool.
      The infection process involves the transfer of T-DNA and virulence proteins into 
      the plant cell. At that time the gene expression patterns of host plants differ
      depending on the Agrobacterium strain, plant species and cell-type used. Later
      on, integration of the T-DNA into the plant host genome, expression of the
      encoded oncogenes, and increase in phytohormone levels induce a fundamental
      reprogramming of the transformed cells. This results in their proliferation and
      finally formation of plant tumors. The process of reprogramming is accompanied by
      altered gene expression, morphology and metabolism. In addition to changes in the
      transcriptome and metabolome, further genome-wide ("omic") approaches have
      recently deepened our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of crown 
      gall tumor formation. This review summarizes the current knowledge about plant
      responses in the course of tumor development. Special emphasis is placed on the
      connection between epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and morphological
      changes in the developing tumor. These changes not only result in abnormally
      proliferating host cells with a heterotrophic and transport-dependent metabolism,
      but also cause differentiation and serve as mechanisms to balance pathogen
      defense and adapt to abiotic stress conditions, thereby allowing the coexistence 
      of the crown gall and host plant.

      epichlorohydrin.
PG  - 1145-58

AB  - A gene encoding halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      CCTCC M 87071 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. To increase activity 
      and stability of HHDH, 14 amino acid residues around the active site and
      substrate-binding pocket based on the structural analysis and molecular docking
      were selected as targets for site-directed mutagenesis. The studies showed that
      the mutant HHDH (Mut-HHDH) enzyme had a more accessible substrate-binding pocket 
      than the wild-type HHDH (Wt-HHDH). Molecular docking revealed that the distance
      between the substrate and active site was closer in mutant which improved the
      catalytic activity. The expressed Wt-HHDH and Mut-HHDH were purified and
      characterized using 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP) as substrates. The specific
      activity of the mutant was enhanced 26-fold and the value of k cat was 18.4-fold 
      as compared to the Wt-HHDH, respectively. The Mut-HHDH showed threefold extension
      of half-life at 45 degrees C than that of Wt-HHDH. Therefore it is possible to
      add 1,3-DCP concentration up to 100 mM and epichlorohydrin (ECH) was produced at 
      a relatively high conversion and yield (59.6 %) using Mut-HHDH as catalyst. This 
      Mut-HHDH could be a potential candidate for the upscale production of ECH.

TI  - Crystal structure of the novel haloalkane dehalogenase DatA from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens C58 reveals a special halide-stabilizing pair and enantioselectivity 
      mechanism.
PG  - 8573-82
LID - 10.1007/s00253-014-5751-2 [doi]
AB  - A novel haloalkane dehalogenase DatA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 belongs
      to the HLD-II subfamily and hydrolyzes brominated and iodinated compounds,
      leading to the generation of the corresponding alcohol, a halide ion, and a
      proton. Because DatA possesses a unique Asn-Tyr pair instead of the Asn-Trp pair 
      conserved among the subfamily members, which was proposed to keep the released
      halide ion stable, the structural basis for its reaction mechanism should be
      elucidated. Here, we determined the crystal structures of DatA and its Y109W
      mutant at 1.70 and 1.95 A, respectively, and confirmed the location of the active
      site by using its novel competitive inhibitor. The structural information from
      these two crystal structures and the docking simulation suggested that (i) the
      replacement of the Asn-Tyr pair with the Asn-Trp pair increases the binding
      affinity for some halogenated compounds, such as 1,3-dibromopropane, mainly due
      to the electrostatic interaction between Trp109 and halogenated compounds and the
      change of substrate-binding mode caused by the interaction and (ii) the primary
      halide-stabilizing residue is only Asn43 in the wild-type DatA, while Tyr109 is a
      secondary halide-stabilizing residue. Furthermore, docking simulation using the
      crystal structures of DatA indicated that its enantioselectivity is determined by
      the large and small spaces around the halogen-binding site.

TI  - Membrane lipids in Agrobacterium tumefaciens: biosynthetic pathways and
      importance for pathogenesis.
PG  - 109
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00109 [doi]
AB  - Many cellular processes critically depend on the membrane composition. In this
      review, we focus on the biosynthesis and physiological roles of membrane lipids
      in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The major components of A.
      tumefaciens membranes are the phospholipids (PLs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
      phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin, and ornithine
      lipids (OLs). Under phosphate-limited conditions, the membrane composition shifts
      to phosphate-free lipids like glycolipids, OLs and a betaine lipid. Remarkably,
      PC and OLs have opposing effects on virulence of A. tumefaciens. OL-lacking A.
      tumefaciens mutants form tumors on the host plant earlier than the wild type
      suggesting a reduced host defense response in the absence of OLs. In contrast, A.
      tumefaciens is compromised in tumor formation in the absence of PC. In general,
      PC is a rare component of bacterial membranes but amount to ~22% of all PLs in A.
      tumefaciens. PC biosynthesis occurs via two pathways. The phospholipid
      N-methyltransferase PmtA methylates PE via the intermediates monomethyl-PE and
      dimethyl-PE to PC. In the second pathway, the membrane-integral enzyme PC
      synthase (Pcs) condenses choline with CDP-diacylglycerol to PC. Apart from the
      virulence defect, PC-deficient A. tumefaciens pmtA and pcs double mutants show
      reduced motility, enhanced biofilm formation and increased sensitivity towards
      detergent and thermal stress. In summary, there is cumulative evidence that the
      membrane lipid composition of A. tumefaciens is critical for agrobacterial
      physiology and tumor formation.

TI  - Involvement of the Acr3 and DctA anti-porters in arsenite oxidation in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A.
PG  - 1950-62
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.12468 [doi]
AB  - Microbial arsenite (AsIII) oxidation forms a critical piece of the arsenic cycle 
      in nature, though our understanding of how and why microorganisms oxidize AsIII
      remains rudimentary. Our model organism Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A contains two
      distinct ars operons (ars1 and ars2) that are similar in their coding region
      content. The ars1 operon is located nearby the aio operon that is essential for
      AsIII oxidation. The AsIII/H(+) anti-porters encoded by acr3-1 and acr3-2 are
      required for maximal AsIII and antimonite (SbIII) resistance, but acr3-1
      (negatively regulated by ArsR-1) appears more active in this regard and also
      required for AsIII oxidation and expression of aioBA. A malate-phosphate
      anti-porter DctA is regulated by RpoN and AsIII, and is required for normal
      growth with malate as a sole carbon source. Qualitatively, a DeltadctA mutant was
      normal for AsIII oxidation and AsIII/SbIII resistance at metalloid concentrations
      inhibitory to the Deltaacr3-1 mutant; however, aioBA induction kinetics was
      significantly phase-shift delayed. Acr3 involvement in AsIII/SbIII resistance is 
      reasonably well understood, but the role of Acr3 and DctA anti-porters in AsIII
      oxidation and its regulation is unexpected, and suggests that controlled AsIII
      trafficking across the cytoplasmic membrane is important to a process understood 
      to occur in the periplasm.

PG  - 1926-40
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.12465 [doi]
AB  - The fate of arsenate (As(V) ) generated by microbial arsenite (As(III) )
      oxidation is poorly understood. Agrobacterium tumefaciens wild-type strain (GW4) 
      was studied to determine how the cell copes with As(V) generated in batch
      culture. GW4 grown heterotrophically with mannitol used As(III) as a supplemental
      energy supply as reflected by enhanced growth and increased cellular levels of
      NADH and ATP. Under low phosphate (Pi) conditions and presence of As(III)
      oxidation, up to approximately 50% of the resulting As(V) was taken up and found 
      associated with the periplasm, membrane or cytoplasm fractions of the cells.
      Arsenic was found associated with proteins and polar lipids, but not in nucleic
      acids or sugars. Thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry analysis suggested the presence of arsenolipids in membranes,
      presumably as part of the bilayer structure of the cell membrane and replacing Pi
      under Pi-limiting conditions. The potential role of a Pi-binding protein (PstS)
      for As(V) uptake was assessed with the His-tag purified protein. Intrinsic
      tryptophan fluorescence spectra analysis suggests that PstS can bind As(V) , but 
      with lower affinity as compared with Pi. In early stationary phase cells, the
      As(V) : Pi ratio was approximately 4.3 and accompanied by an altered cell
      ultrastructure.

      the causal agent of gummosis in cashew nut plants.
PG  - 2906-13
LID - 10.4238/2014.February.21.8 [doi]
AB  - Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a major pathogen of many different crop cultures,
      including cashew nut plants. This paper describes an efficient Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system for the successful delivery of 
      T-DNA, transferring the genes of green fluorescent protein (gfp) and hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase (hph) to L. theobromae. When the fungal pycnidiospores were
      co-cultured with A. tumefaciens harboring the binary vector with hph-gfp gene,
      hygromycin-resistant fungus only developed with acetosyringone supplementation.
      The cashew plants inoculated with the fungus expressing GFP revealed
      characteristic pathogen colonization by epifluorescence microscopy. Intense and
      bright green hyphae were observed for transformants in all extensions of mycelium
      cultures. The penetration of parenchyma cells near to the inoculation site,
      beneath the epicuticle surface, was observed prior to 25 dpi. Penetration was
      followed by the development of hyphae within invaded host cells. These findings
      provide a rapid and reproducible ATMT method for L. theobromae transformation.

      responsible for this Thr phosphorylation regulation, and the forkhead-associated 
      (FHA) domain-containing Fha-family protein is the sole T6SS phosphorylation
      substrate identified to date. Here we discovered that TssL, the T6SS
      inner-membrane core component, is phosphorylated and the phosphorylated TssL
      (p-TssL) activates type VI subassembly and secretion in a plant pathogenic
      bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Combining genetic and biochemical
      approaches, we demonstrate that TssL is phosphorylated at Thr 14 in a
      PpkA-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that the PpkA kinase activity is
      responsible for the Thr 14 phosphorylation, which is critical for the secretion
      of the T6SS hallmark protein Hcp and the putative toxin effector Atu4347. TssL
      phosphorylation is not required for the formation of the TssM-TssL inner-membrane
      complex but is critical for TssM conformational change and binding to Hcp and
      Atu4347. Importantly, Fha specifically interacts with phosphothreonine of TssL
      via its pThr-binding motif in vivo and in vitro and this interaction is crucial
      for TssL interaction with Hcp and Atu4347 and activation of type VI secretion. In
      contrast, pThr-binding ability of Fha is dispensable for TssM structural
      transition. In conclusion, we discover a novel Thr phosphorylation event, in
      which PpkA phosphorylates TssL to activate type VI secretion via its direct
      binding to Fha in A. tumefaciens. A model depicting an ordered TssL
      phosphorylation-induced T6SS assembly pathway is proposed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a transformation system in Gliocladium sp. 6.102, a
      Cordyceps-colonizing fungus producing a variety of epipolythiodioxopiperazine
      (ETP) compounds with drug potentials. METHODS: Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) was used to transform Gliocladium sp. 6.102. The factors of
      bacterial cell concentration, co-cultivation time, pH and acetosyringone
      concentration were optimized. RESULTS; A total of 50 -100 transformants per 10(6)
      fungal conidia was obtained via the optimal ATMT method. The genes encoding
      hygromycin B phosphotase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were
      transferred into Gliocladium sp. by the optimal ATMT method. The marker genes
      were successfully expressed and stably maintained in the transgenic fungus.
      CONCLUSION: A transformation system was established for Gliocladium sp. 6.102 and
      this system may be useful to identify ETP biosynthetic genes in Gliocladium.

AB  - Transient expression of recombinant proteins in plant tissues following
      Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is a promising technique for rapid protein
      production. However, transformation rates and transient expression levels can be 
      sub-optimal depending on process conditions. Attachment of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens to plant cells is an early, critical step in the gene transfer
      pathway. Bacterial attachment levels and patterns may influence transformation
      and, by extension, transient expression. In this study, attachment of A.
      tumefaciens to lettuce leaf tissue was investigated in response to varying
      infiltration conditions, including bacterial density, surfactant concentration,
      and applied vacuum level. Bacterial density was found to most influence
      attachment levels for the levels tested (10(8) , 10(9) , and 10(10) CFU/mL), with
      the relationship between bacterial density and attachment levels following a
      saturation trend. Surfactant levels tested (Break-Thru S240: 1, 10, 100, and
      1,000 microL/L) also had a significant positive effect on bacterial attachment
      while vacuum level (5, 25, and 45 kPa) did not significantly affect attachment in
      areas exposed to bacteria. In planta transgene transient expression levels were
      measured following infiltration with 10(8) , 10(9) , and 10(10) CFU/mL bacterial 
      suspension. Notably, the highest attachment level tested led to a decrease in
      transient expression, suggesting a potential link between bacterial attachment
      levels and downstream phenomena that may induce gene silencing. These results
      illustrate that attachment can be controlled by adjusting infiltration conditions
      and that attachment levels can impact transgene transient expression in leaf
      tissue.

TI  - Roles of Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin (MbfA) in iron
      transport and resistance to iron under acidic conditions.
PG  - 863-871
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.076802-0 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin (MbfA) is a member of the
      erythrin (Er)-vacuolar iron transport family. The MbfA protein has an Er or
      ferritin-like domain at its N terminus and has been predicted to have five
      transmembrane segments in its C-terminal region. Analysis of protein localization
      using PhoA and LacZ reporter proteins supported the view that the N-terminal
      di-iron site is located in the cytoplasm whilst the C-terminal end faces the
      periplasm. An A. tumefaciens mbfA mutant strain had 1.5-fold higher total iron
      content than the WT strain. Furthermore, multi-copy expression of mbfA reduced
      total iron content two- and threefold in WT and mbfA mutant backgrounds,
      respectively. These results suggest that MbfA may function as an iron exporter
      rather than an iron storage protein. The mbfA mutant showed 10-fold increased
      sensitivity to the iron-activated antibiotic streptonigrin, implying that the
      mutant had increased accumulation of intracellular free iron. Growth of the mbfA 
      mutant was reduced in the presence of high iron under acidic conditions. The
      expression of mbfA was induced highly in cells grown in iron-replete medium at pH
      5.5, further supporting the view that mbfA is involved in the response to iron
      under acidic conditions. A. tumefaciens MbfA may play a protective role against
      increased free iron in the cytoplasm through iron binding and export, thus
      preventing iron-induced toxicity via the Fenton reaction.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of corn (Zea mays L.) multiple 
      shoots.
PG  - 208-216
AB  - An Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated corn transformation method based on
      multiple shoot tissue cultures was developed, which is effective with a variety
      of corn inbred lines and standard binary vectors. Six factors that affected the
      success of corn transformation were tested, including A. tumefaciens strain, corn
      genotype, tissue culture growth stage, medium composition, co-culture temperature
      and surfactant treatment. Agropine-type bacteria (EHA 101 and AGL 1) were
      eightfold more effective than octopine-type strain for corn multi-shoot tissues
      transformation. The average frequency of Glucuronidase (GUS)-positive explants
      obtained from 14 corn genotypes ranged from 36% to 76%. L-proline (0.7 g L(-1))
      in the co-culture medium apparently improved the frequency of transformation. The
      newly initiated multi-shoot tissues were most responsive to Agrobacterium
      infection. A positive correlation was found between multi-shoot tissue
      susceptibility to Agrobacterium and the proportion of cells in G1 phase.
      Transformants were identified by reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction 
      (PCR) and by southern blot hybridization assays. The frequency of transformants
      was approximately 2% based on the number of multi-shoot explants co-cultivated
      with Agrobacterium.

AB  - Ustilago scitaminea is the causal agent of sugar-cane smut disease. There is,
      however, no genetic transformation method for it. Here we report the development 
      of an efficient mutagenesis method based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation. To improve transformation efficiency, a range of conditions,
      including the codon-usage preference of the selection marker gene, promoters and 
      the culture conditions for transformation were optimized. A strong promoter to
      drive marker gene expression, optimized codon usage of selection marker gene,
      controlled water content and pH of co-culture medium were critical factors
      affecting transformation efficiency. Our findings provide a useful tool for
      genetic analysis of this important plant pathogen.

TI  - A bifunctional glycosyltransferase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens synthesizes
      monoglucosyl and glucuronosyl diacylglycerol under phosphate deprivation.
PG  - 10104-14

AB  - Glycolipids are mainly found in phototrophic organisms (like plants and
      cyanobacteria), in Gram-positive bacteria, and a few other bacterial phyla.
      Besides the function as bulk membrane lipids, they often play a role under
      phosphate deprivation as surrogates for phospholipids. The Gram-negative
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens accumulates four different glycolipids under phosphate 
      deficiency, including digalactosyl diacylglycerol and glucosylgalactosyl
      diacylglycerol synthesized by a processive glycosyltransferase. The other two
      glycolipids have now been identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy as monoglucosyl diacylglycerol and glucuronosyl
      diacylglycerol. These two lipids are synthesized by a single promiscuous
      glycosyltransferase encoded by the ORF atu2297, with UDP-glucose or
      UDP-glucuronic acid as sugar donors. The transfer of sugars differing in their
      chemistry is a novel feature not observed before for lipid glycosyltransferases. 
      Furthermore, this enzyme is the first glucuronosyl diacylglycerol synthase
      isolated. Deletion mutants of Agrobacterium lacking monoglucosyl diacylglycerol
      and glucuronosyl diacylglycerol or all glycolipids are not impaired in growth or 
      virulence during infection of tobacco leaf discs. Our data suggest that the four 
      glycolipids and the nonphospholipid diacylglyceryl trimethylhomoserine can
      mutually replace each other during phosphate deprivation. This redundancy of
      different nonphospholipids may represent an adaptation mechanism to enhance the
      competitiveness in nature.

AB  - Valsa mali var. mali (Vmm), which is the causative agent of Valsa canker of apple
      tree, causes heavy damage to apple production in eastern Asia. In this article,
      we report Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) of Vmm and
      expression of gfp (green fluorescent protein) in this fungus. The transformation 
      system was optimized to a transformation efficiency of approximately 150
      transformants/10(6) conidia, and a library containing over 4,000 transformants
      was generated. The tested transformants were mitotically stable. One hundred
      percent hph (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) integration into Vmm was identified
      by PCR and five single-copy integration of T-DNA was detected in the eighteen
      transformants by Southern blot. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
      ATMT of Vmm. Furthermore, this library has been used to identify genes involved
      in the virulence of the pathogen, and the transformation system may also be
      useful to the transformation of other species of the genus Valsa.

TI  - Functions and regulation of quorum-sensing in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2014.00014 [doi]
AB  - In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, horizontal transfer and vegetative replication of
      oncogenic Ti plasmids involve a cell-to-cell communication process called
      quorum-sensing (QS). The determinants of the QS-system belong to the LuxR/LuxI
      class. The LuxI-like protein TraI synthesizes N-acyl-homoserine lactone molecules
      which act as diffusible QS-signals. Beyond a threshold concentration, these
      molecules bind and activate the LuxR-like transcriptional regulator TraR, thereby
      initiating the QS-regulatory pathway. For the last 20 years, A. tumefaciens has
      stood as a prominent model in the understanding of the LuxR/LuxI type of QS
      systems. A number of studies also unveiled features which are unique to A.
      tumefaciens QS, some of them being directly related to the phytopathogenic
      lifestyle of the bacteria. In this review, we will present the current knowledge 
      of QS in A. tumefaciens at both the genetic and molecular levels. We will also
      describe how interactions with plant host modulate the QS pathway of A.
      tumefaciens, and discuss what could be the advantages for the agrobacteria to use
      such a tightly regulated QS-system to disseminate the Ti plasmids.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a second quorum-sensing system in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens A6.
PG  - 1403-11
LID - 10.1128/JB.01351-13 [doi]
AB  - Quorum sensing (QS) is a widespread mechanism of bacterial communication in which
      individual cells produce and respond to small chemical signals. In Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens, an acylhomoserine lactone-dependent QS mechanism is known to
      regulate the replication and conjugation of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid. Most
      of the QS regulatory proteins are encoded within the Ti plasmid. Among them, TraI
      is the LuxI-type enzyme synthesizing the QS signal N-3-oxooctanoyl-L-homoserine
      lactone (3OC8HSL), TraR is the LuxR-type transcriptional factor that recognizes
      3OC8HSL, and TraM is an antiactivator that antagonizes TraR. Recently, we
      identified a TraM homolog encoded by the traM2 gene in the chromosomal background
      of A. tumefaciens A6. In this study, we further identified additional homologs
      (TraI2 and TraR2) of TraI and TraR in this strain. We showed that similar to
      TraI, TraI2 could predominantly synthesize the QS signal 3OC8HSL. We also showed 
      that TraR2 could recognize 3OC8HSL and activate the tra box-containing promoters 
      as efficiently as TraR. Further analysis showed that traM2, traI2, and traR2 are 
      physically linked on a mobile genetic element that is not related to the Ti
      plasmid. These findings indicate that A. tumefaciens A6 carries a second QS
      system that may play a redundant role in the regulation of the replication and
      conjugation of the Ti plasmid.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) has been widely used in 
      various organisms. In the current study, we developed a simple and efficient
      system for genetic transformation of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus
      using ATMT. The transformation protocol was optimized for certain parameters to
      rapidly generate a library of Transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants of A.
      terreus. The presence of mitotically stable hygromycin resistance gene (hph)
      integration in the genome was confirmed by PCR, and T-DNA flanking sequences were
      cloned by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. The successful construction of the
      mutant library demonstrated the utility of the ATMT approach for future forward
      and reverse genetic studies in this important fungus.

PG  - 1240-51
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12531 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells carrying a tumour inducing plasmid (Ti-plasmid)
      can transfer a defined region of transfer DNA (T-DNA) to plant cells as well as
      to yeast. This process of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) eventually 
      results in the incorporation of the T-DNA in the genomic DNA of the recipient
      cells. All available evidence indicates that T-strand transfer closely resembles 
      conjugal DNA transfer as found between Gram-negative bacteria. However, where
      conjugal plasmid DNA transfer starts via relaxase-mediated processing of a single
      origin of transfer (oriT), the T-DNA is flanked by two imperfect direct border
      repeats which are both substrates for the Ti-plasmid encoded relaxase VirD2.
      Yeast was used as a model system to investigate the requirements of the recipient
      cell for the formation of T-DNA circles after AMT. It was found that, despite the
      absence of self-homology on the T-DNA, the homologous repair proteins Rad52 and
      Rad51 are involved in T-DNA circle formation. A model is presented involving the 
      formation of T-DNA concatemers derived from T-strands by a process of
      strand-transfer catalysed by VirD2. These concatemers are then resolved into
      T-DNA circles by homologous recombination in the recipient cell.

TI  - A signaling pathway involving the diguanylate cyclase CelR and the response
      regulator DivK controls cellulose synthesis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 1257-74
LID - 10.1128/JB.01446-13 [doi]
AB  - The production of cellulose fibrils is involved in the attachment of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens to its plant host. Consistent with previous studies, we
      reported recently that a putative diguanylate cyclase, celR, is required for
      synthesis of this polymer in A. tumefaciens. In this study, the effects of celR
      and other components of the regulatory pathway of cellulose production were
      explored. Mutational analysis of celR demonstrated that the cyclase requires the 
      catalytic GGEEF motif, as well as the conserved aspartate residue of a CheY-like 
      receiver domain, for stimulating cellulose production. Moreover, a site-directed 
      mutation within the PilZ domain of CelA, the catalytic subunit of the cellulose
      synthase complex, greatly reduced cellulose production. In addition, deletion of 
      divK, the first gene of the divK-celR operon, also reduced cellulose production. 
      This requirement for divK was alleviated by expression of a constitutively active
      form of CelR, suggesting that DivK acts upstream of CelR activation. Based on
      bacterial two-hybrid assays, CelR homodimerizes but does not interact with DivK. 
      The mutation in divK additionally affected cell morphology, and this effect was
      complementable by a wild-type copy of the gene, but not by the constitutively
      active allele of celR. These results support the hypothesis that CelR is a bona
      fide c-di-GMP synthase and that the nucleotide signal produced by this enzyme
      activates CelA via the PilZ domain. Our studies also suggest that the DivK/CelR
      signaling pathway in Agrobacterium regulates cellulose production independent of 
      cell cycle checkpoint systems that are controlled by divK.

AB  - D-galacturonic acid is the main component of pectin. It could be used to produce 
      affordable renewable fuels, chemicals and materials through biotechnical
      conversion. Keto-deoxy-D-galactarate (KDG) dehydratase is an enzyme in the
      oxidative pathway of D-galacturonic acid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At). It
      converts 3-deoxy-2-keto-L-threo-hexarate to alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde. At
      KDG dehydratase was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The
      crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
      169.1, b = 117.8, c = 74.3 A, beta = 112.4 degrees and an asymmetric unit of four
      monomers. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.9 A resolution using
      synchrotron radiation. The three-dimensional structure of At KDG dehydratase will
      provide valuable information on the function of the enzyme and will allow it to
      be engineered for biorefinery-based applications.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of the lichen fungus,
      Umbilicaria muehlenbergii.
PG  - e83896
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0083896 [doi]
AB  - Transformation-mediated mutagenesis in both targeted and random manners has been 
      widely applied to decipher gene function in diverse fungi. However, a
      transformation system has not yet been established for lichen fungi, severely
      limiting our ability to study their biology and mechanism underpinning symbiosis 
      via gene manipulation. Here, we report the first successful transformation of the
      lichen fungus, Umbilicaria muehlenbergii, via the use of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. We generated a total of 918 transformants employing a binary vector 
      that carries the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene as a selection marker and
      the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene for labeling transformants. Randomly 
      selected transformants appeared mitotically stable, based on their maintenance of
      hygromycin B resistance after five generations of growth without selection.
      Genomic Southern blot showed that 88% of 784 transformants contained a single
      T-DNA insert in their genome. A number of putative mutants affected in colony
      color, size, and/or morphology were found among these transformants, supporting
      the utility of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) for
      random insertional mutagenesis of U. muehlenbergii. This ATMT approach
      potentially offers a systematic gene functional study with genome sequences of U.
      muehlenbergii that is currently underway.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Valsa mali: an efficient
      tool for random insertion mutagenesis.
PG  - 968432
LID - 10.1155/2013/968432 [doi]
AB  - Valsa mali is a causal agent of apple and pear trees canker disease, which is a
      destructive disease that causes serious economic losses in eastern Asia,
      especially in China. The lack of an efficient transformation system for Valsa
      mali retards its investigation, which poses difficulties to control the disease. 
      In this research, a transformation system for this pathogen was established for
      the first time using A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT), with the
      optimal transformation conditions as follows: 10(6)/mL conidia suspension,
      cocultivation temperature 22 degrees C, cocultivation time 72 hours, and 200 mu M
      acetosyringone (AS) in the inductive medium. The average transformation
      efficiency was 1015.00 +/- 37.35 transformants per 10(6) recipient conidia.
      Thirty transformants were randomly selected for further confirmation and the
      results showed the presence of T-DNA in all hygromycin B resistant transformants 
      and also revealed random and single gene integration with genetic stability.
      Compared with wild-type strain, those transformants exhibited various differences
      in morphology, conidia production, and conidia germination ability. In addition, 
      pathogenicity assays revealed that 14 transformants had mitigated pathogenicity, 
      while one had enhanced infection ability. The results suggest that ATMT of V.
      mali is a useful tool to gain novel insight into this economically important
      pathogen at molecular levels.

AB  - Many methods have been used to isolate genomic DNA, but some of them are
      time-consuming and costly, especially when extracting a large number of samples. 
      Here we described an easy protocol using two simple solutions for DNA extraction 
      from A. tumefaciens cells. Compared with the standard protocol, this protocol
      allows rapid DNA isolation with comparable yield and purity at negligible cost.
      Following this protocol, we have demonstrated: (1) gDNA extraction was achieved
      within 15 min; (2) this method was cost-effective, since it only used calcium
      chloride and lysozyme; SDS, phenol, chloroform and proteinase K were not
      necessary; (3) the method gave high yield of gDNA (130 ng/loopful culture)
      compared with standard protocol that was suitable for restriction analysis; (4)
      the protocol can be carried out in a single test tube and the cells directly from
      solid media can be used. Thus, this protocol offers an easy, efficient and
      economical way to extract genomic DNA from A. tumefaciens.

AB  - A novel transformation system was established for maize using Agrobacterium
      infection of in vitro cultured ovules. The maize ovules were isolated 24h after
      pollination and infected with Agrobacterium. The embryos were isolated from the
      pollinated ovules 2-3 weeks after Agrobacterium infection, regenerated to
      plantlets and investigated for transgene expression and inheritance. Experimental
      evaluations were focused on the four main aspects. Firstly, through the
      introduction of gus gene for monitoring transformation and development of embryo,
      it was confirmed that transgenic plants can be generated from in vitro cultured
      maize ovules infected with Agrobacterium. Secondly, in order to standardize the
      transformation protocol, several important factors that affected transformation
      efficiency were optimized. They included Agrobacterium delivery approach,
      surfactant, AS concentration, and cocultivation duration. Thirdly, stable
      expression and Mendelian inheritance of the introduced genes were analyzed in
      independent lines over two generations. Fourthly, the pollinated ovule
      culture-regeneration potential and transformation efficiency of five maize inbred
      lines were investigated to confirm the genotype independence of this
      transformation system. We conclude that the transformation system established in 
      this study can be used to generate high-quality transgenic maize plants rapidly
      and directly.

LID - 10.1007/s00253-013-5412-x [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been widely used as a tool for transgenesis in
      plants. The availability of its genome sequence should facilitate the directed
      engineering of improved properties; however, the current genome engineering
      options are laborious. Here, we investigated whether the lambda Red operon can be
      applied for recombineering of the A. tumefaciens genome. First, we built an
      expression plasmid for A. tumefaciens employing a tetracycline-inducible promoter
      to regulate the Red operon. This multicopy plasmid was then itself modified in A.
      tumefaciens to verify that the Red operon was functional. Then, we modified the
      endogenous A. tumefaciens tumor-inducing plasmid and the linear chromosome. These
      results extend recombineering technology to a new host and indicate a fast and
      convenient way to engineer the A. tumefaciens genome for functional genomics and 
      strain improvements.

TI  - Rapid regeneration and ploidy stability of 'cv IR36' indica rice (Oryza Sativa.
      L) confers efficient protocol for in vitro callus organogenesis and Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens mediated transformation.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/1999-3110-54-47 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cereal crops are the major targets for transformation mediated crop
      improvement and IR36 is an early maturing, high yielding, insect and disease
      resistant rice variety however, it is abiotic stress sensitive. Hence,
      development of an efficient and reproducible micropropagation system via somatic 
      embryogenesis and Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation is
      prerequisite to develop abiotic stress tolerant IR36. Further, Genetic stability 
      of analysis of plantlets through RAPD and ISSR and Ploidy level through Flow
      cytometry (FCM) measurement of 2C DNA content is necessary for future application
      of transformed IR36. RESULTS: In this study, Mature seeds inoculated on
      (Murashige and Skoog) MS medium with 11.31 muM 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
      (2, 4-D) and 0.3 muM Kinetin (Kn) had highest callus induction frequency (98%).
      The highest regeneration frequency (80%) was observed in MS + 13.28 muM
      Benzyladenine (BA) with 8.06 muM alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Randomly
      Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and Flow
      Cytometry (FCM) analysis showed no significant variation in the 2C DNA (0.81
      pg/2C) content and Ploidy level between wild type IR36 and in vitro maintained
      rice lines. Of the various OD bacterial culture, an optimum OD of 0.4 and
      inoculation duration of 10 min resulted in efficient Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation. beta-glucuronidase activity was maximum in callus (99.05%).
      CONCLUSIONS: These results described here confirm the reliability of this
      protocol for micropropagation and delivery of desirable gene using A. tumefaciens
      into indica rice.

TI  - Global analysis of differentially expressed genes and proteins in the wheat
      callus infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e79390
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0079390 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is an extremely complex and evolved
      process involving genetic determinants of both the bacteria and the host plant
      cells. However, the mechanism of the determinants remains obscure, especially in 
      some cereal crops such as wheat, which is recalcitrant for Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
      differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed in wheat callus cells
      co-cultured with Agrobacterium by using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and
      two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry
      (MS). A set of 4,889 DEGs and 90 DEPs were identified, respectively. Most of them
      are related to metabolism, chromatin assembly or disassembly and immune defense. 
      After comparative analysis, 24 of the 90 DEPs were detected in RNA-seq and
      proteomics datasets simultaneously. In addition, real-time RT-PCR experiments
      were performed to check the differential expression of the 24 genes, and the
      results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. According to gene ontology (GO)
      analysis, we found that a big part of these differentially expressed genes were
      related to the process of stress or immunity response. Several putative
      determinants and candidate effectors responsive to Agrobacterium mediated
      transformation of wheat cells were discussed. We speculate that some of these
      genes are possibly related to Agrobacterium infection. Our results will help to
      understand the interaction between Agrobacterium and host cells, and may
      facilitate developing efficient transformation strategies in cereal crops.

AB  - In this study, we developed a rapid and efficient method for in vitro propagation
      and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Digitalis purpurea L.
      (syn. foxglove), an important medicinal plant. Mature leaf explants of D.
      purpurea were used for 100 % adventitious shoot regeneration on Murashige and
      Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 mg L(-1) thidiazuron (TDZ) (a cytokine) and
      0.1 mg L(-1) 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (an auxin). Transformation was
      achieved by inoculating leaf explants with the A. tumefaciens strains
      GV2260/pBI121 or GV3101/pBI121. The binary vector pBI121 contained the reporter
      beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) and kanamycin selection marker nptII.
      Kanamycin-resistant shoots were regenerated directly on the selection medium 4-6 
      weeks after co-cultivation. Approximately, 52.2 and 60 % of kanamycin-resistant
      shoots transformed with Agrobacterium strains GV2260 and GV3101, respectively,
      showed strong GUS staining by histochemical assay. Furthermore, PCR and Southern 
      blot analysis confirmed the presence of nptII and GUS on the chromosome of the
      transformed D. purpurea plants, and stable GUS expression was detected in the
      transformants by RT-PCR analysis. This efficient method of shoot regeneration and
      genetic transformation of D. purpurea will provide a powerful tool to increase
      and produce valuable components such as digitoxin, digoxin, and digoxigenin in D.
      purpurea through improved secondary metabolic pathways via a biotechnological
      approach.

TI  - Cysteine desulphurase-encoding gene sufS2 is required for the repressor function 
      of RirA and oxidative resistance in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 79-90
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.068643-0 [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens genome contains a cluster of genes that are
      predicted to encode Fe-S cluster assembly proteins, and this cluster is known as 
      the sufS2BCDS1XA operon. sufS2 is the first gene in the operon, and it was
      inactivated to determine its physiological function. The sufS2 mutant exhibited a
      small colony phenotype, grew slower than the wild-type strain and was more
      sensitive to various oxidants including peroxide, organic hydroperoxide and
      superoxide. The sufS2 gene was negatively regulated by iron response regulator
      (Irr) and rhizobial iron regulator (RirA) under low and high iron conditions,
      respectively, and was inducible in response to oxidative stress. The
      oxidant-induced expression of sufS2 was controlled by Irr, RirA and an additional
      but not yet identified mechanism. sufS2 was required for RirA activity in the
      repression of a sufS2 promoter-lacZ fusion. RirA may use Fe-S as its cofactor.
      sufS2 disruption may cause a defect in the Fe-S supply and could thereby affect
      the RirA activity. The three conserved cysteine residues (C91, C99 and C105) in
      RirA were predicted to coordinate with the Fe-S cluster and were shown to be
      essential for RirA repression of the sufS2-lacZ fusion. These results suggested
      that sufS2 is important for the survival of A. tumefaciens.

AB  - Fundamental research aimed to determine the limits of the Agrobacterium transfer 
      DNA (T-DNA) element that stably inserted into plant nuclear DNA to cause crown
      gall tumor formation. The T-DNA borders were discovered to be exceedingly
      precise, revealing that T-DNA insertion into the plant genome was reproducible
      and exact. Deletion of the internal regions of the T-DNA, to remove the tumor
      forming genes, while retaining the T-DNA borders, resulted again in efficient DNA
      transfer to plant cells, but now such cells were capable of completely normal
      growth and differentiation. Thus, the internal region of the T-DNA was not needed
      for DNA transfer, and one could envisage insertion of any DNA of interest in
      between the T-DNA borders. Thus began plant genetic engineering.

      somaclones up to glasshouse acclimatization has been achieved. Inter-simple
      sequence repeat (ISSR) profiling of transgenic and somaclonal plants showed a
      total of 113 bands, out of which 49 were monomorphic (43.36 %) and 64 were
      polymorphic (56.64 %). Transgenic plant was found to be closer to mother plant,
      while on the basis of steviol, stevioside, and rebaudioside A profile, somaclone 
      S2 was found to be the best and showed maximum variability in ISSR profiling.

TI  - High throughput Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated germline transformation of

PG  - 153-64
LID - 10.1007/s00299-013-1519-x [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediates high frequency of germline
      transformation of cotton meristem explants. The meristem transformation system we
      developed is rapid, high throughput and genotype-flexible. We have developed a
      high throughput cotton transformation system based on direct Agrobacterium
      inoculation of mechanically isolated meristem explants of cotton (Gossypium
      hirsutum L.). The explants were inoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain,
      AB33 harboring a 2 T-DNA binary vector pMON114908. This vector contained a gene
      of interest, an intron-disrupted beta-glucuronidase gene in one T-DNA, and a
      selectable marker gene, aadA in the other T-DNA. Critical factors, such as method
      of co-culture, culture temperature during selection, composition of selection
      medium, and selection scheme were found to influence transformation frequency.
      The cycle time from initial inoculation to the transplanting of transgenic plants
      to soil was 7-8 weeks. Stable integration of transgenes and their transmission to
      progeny were confirmed by molecular and genetic analyses. Transgenes segregated
      in the expected Mendelian fashion in the T1 generation for most of the transgenic
      events. It was possible to recover marker-free events in the T1 generation when
      utilizing a binary vector that contained the selectable marker and gene of
      interest expression cassettes on independent T-DNAs. The procedure presented here
      has been used to regenerate thousands of independent transgenic events from
      multiple varieties with numerous constructs, and we believe it represents a major
      step forward in cotton transformation technology.

TI  - Concerted transfer of the virulence Ti plasmid and companion At plasmid in the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced plant tumour.
PG  - 1178-89
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12423 [doi]
AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 harbours three independent type 
      IV secretion (T4SS) machineries. T4SST-DNA promotes the transfer of the T-DNA to 
      host plant cells, provoking tumour development and accumulation of opines such as
      nopaline and agrocinopines. T4SSpTi and T4SSpAt control the bacterial conjugation
      of the Ti and At plasmids respectively. Expression of T4SSpTi is controlled by
      the agrocinopine-responsive transcriptional repressor AccR. In this work, we
      compared the genome-wide transcriptional profile of the wild-type A. tumefaciens 
      strain C58 with that of its accR KO-mutant to delineate the AccR regulon. In
      addition to the genes that encode agrocinopine catabolism and T4SSpTi , we found 
      that AccR also regulated genes coding for nopaline catabolism and T4SSpAt .
      Further opine detection and conjugation assays confirmed the enhancement of
      nopaline consumption and At plasmid conjugation frequency in accR. Moreover,
      co-regulation of the T4SSpTi and T4SSpAt correlated with the co-transfer of the
      At and Ti plasmids both in vitro and in plant tumours. Finally, unlike T4SSpTi , 
      T4SSpAt activation does not require quorum-sensing. Overall this study highlights
      the regulatory interplays between opines, At and Ti plasmids that contribute to a
      concerted dissemination of the two replicons in bacterial populations colonizing 
      the plant tumour.

TI  - Biological activity of the tzs gene of nopaline Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 
      in plant regeneration and genetic transformation.
PG  - 1359-65
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-04-13-0106-R [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been widely used in plant genetic transformation.
      Hormone-encoding genes residing in the T-DNA region have been removed, resulting 
      in disarmed Agrobacterium strains that are used in various transformation
      experiments. Nopaline Agrobacterium strains, however, carry another hormone gene,
      trans-zeatin synthesizing (tzs), that codes for trans-zeatin in the virulence
      region of the tumor-inducing plasmids. We investigated the activity and function 
      of the tzs gene of a nopaline Agrobacterium sp. strain GV3101 in plant in vitro
      regeneration. Leaf explants of tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana co-cultured with
      strain GV3101 exhibited active shoot regeneration in media without added plant
      growth regulators. On medium without plant growth regulators, transgenic shoots
      were also induced from explants co-cultured with GV3101 containing a binary
      vector. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that cell-free extracts of
      Agrobacterium sp. strain GV3101 culture contained the trans-zeatin at 860
      ng/liter. Polymerase chain reaction using tzs-specific primers showed that the
      tzs gene was present in strain GV3101 but not in other Agrobacterium strains. The
      study showed that the tzs gene in GV3101 was actively expressed, and that
      trans-zeatin produced in the Agrobacterium strain can promote plant shoot
      regeneration.

AB  - An efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation method was
      successfully established for a newly isolated Taxol-producing fungus, Ozonium sp 
      EFY21. A specific hygromycin B resistance expression vector, pCAMBIA1304'AN7-1,
      was constructed for fungal transformation. Key factors affecting transformation
      efficiency were thoroughly investigated and optimized. PCR amplification and
      Southern hybridization were used to verify the transformation events. This study 
      should pave the way for future genetic modification studies of Ozonium sp EFY21.

AB  - Transient assays provide a convenient alternative to stable transformation.
      Compared to the generation of stably transformed plants, agroinfiltration is more
      rapid, and samples can be analyzed a few days after inoculation. Nevertheless, at
      difference of tobacco and other plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana remains
      recalcitrant to routine transient assays. In this chapter, we describe a
      transient expression assay using simple infiltration of intact Arabidopsis leaves
      with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a plasmid expressing a reporter
      fluorescent protein. In this protocol, Agrobacterium aggressiveness was increased
      by a prolonged treatment in an induction medium deficient in nutrients and
      containing acetosyringone. Besides, Arabidopsis plants were cultivated in
      intermediate photoperiod (12 h light-12 h dark) to promote leaf growth.

TI  - CelR, an ortholog of the diguanylate cyclase PleD of Caulobacter, regulates
      cellulose synthesis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 7188-202
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02148-13 [doi]
AB  - Cellulose fibrils play a role in attachment of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to its
      plant host. While the genes for cellulose biosynthesis in the bacterium have been
      identified, little is known concerning the regulation of the process. The signal 
      molecule cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has been linked to the regulation of
      exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in many bacterial species, including A.
      tumefaciens. In this study, we identified two putative diguanylate cyclase genes,
      celR (atu1297) and atu1060, that influence production of cellulose in A.
      tumefaciens. Overexpression of either gene resulted in increased cellulose
      production, while deletion of celR, but not atu1060, resulted in decreased
      cellulose biosynthesis. celR overexpression also affected other phenotypes,
      including biofilm formation, formation of a polar adhesion structure, plant
      surface attachment, and virulence, suggesting that the gene plays a role in
      regulating these processes. Analysis of celR and Deltacel mutants allowed
      differentiation between phenotypes associated with cellulose production, such as 
      biofilm formation, and phenotypes probably resulting from c-di-GMP signaling,
      which include polar adhesion, attachment to plant tissue, and virulence.
      Phylogenetic comparisons suggest that species containing both celR and celA,
      which encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase, adapted the CelR
      protein to regulate cellulose production while those that lack celA use CelR,
      called PleD, to regulate specific processes associated with polar localization
      and cell division.

PG  - 1860-6
AB  - In this study, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was used 
      in breeding industrial strains for the purpose of improving
      alpha-transglucosidase production. Firstly, an efficient ATMT system for
      Asperillus niger was established by optimization of several influencing factors, 
      in which transformation efficiency was improved up to 14-fold compared with the
      initial conditions. Furthermore, binary vector pBI-Glu containing an
      alpha-transglucosidase expression cassette was constructed and transferred into
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 in order to infect A. niger. By the efficient
      ATMT method, the gene for alpha-transglucosidase, driven by strong promoter PglaA
      (the glucoamylase gene promoter), had a high expression level in A. niger A-8
      (25.02 U/mL). The optimized ATMT system was found to be effective and suitable
      for A. niger, and should be a useful tool for studying the function of A. niger
      genes and for industrial breeding of this strain.

TI  - Increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity enhances
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene delivery into plant cells.
PG  - 873-80
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.123 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a useful tool for the genetic
      modification in plants, although its efficiency is low for several plant species.
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has three major steps in
      laboratory-controlled experiments: the delivery of T-DNA into plant cells, the
      selection of transformed plant cells, and the regeneration of whole plants from
      the selected cells. Each of these steps must be optimized to improve the
      efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. It has been reported
      that increasing the number of cells transformed by T-DNA delivery can improve the
      frequency of stable transformation. Previously, we demonstrated that a reduction 
      in ethylene production by plant cells during cocultivation with A.
      tumefaciens-expressing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase
      resulted in increased T-DNA delivery into the plant cells. In this study, to
      further improve T-DNA delivery by A. tumefaciens, we modified the expression
      cassette of the ACC deaminase gene using vir gene promoter sequences. The ACC
      deaminase gene driven by the virD1 promoter was expressed at a higher level,
      resulting in a higher ACC deaminase activity in this A. tumefaciens strain than
      in the strain with the lac promoter used in a previous study. The newly developed
      A. tumefaciens strain improves the delivery of T-DNA into Solanum lycopersicum
      (tomato) and Erianthus ravennae plants and thus may be a powerful tool for the
      Agrobacterium-mediated genetic engineering of plants.

AB  - Medicago truncatula is a model legume that has all the genomic resources to be
      suitable as a model for functional genomics. Transformation to produce transgenic
      plants is part of this toolkit, enabling a spectrum of approaches to study gene
      function: including knockdown, overexpression, reporter genes for gene
      expression, and proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins such as GFP. A special 
      genetic line is necessary for transformation and Jemalong 2HA derived from cv.
      Jemalong is used in the methods described. Leaf explants can be used for the
      transformation of the embryonic stem cells to produce the transgenic somatic
      embryos for regeneration. An auxin and a cytokinin are the key hormone
      requirements for regeneration by somatic embryogenesis but other hormones such as
      abscisic acid can be used to augment the system. As the explants used in this
      system are from leaves, rather than immature embryos or meristematic tissues
      often used in other species, it is a quite straightforward system. Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens containing a binary vector suitable for the particular objectives is 
      used to deliver the transgene of interest.

TI  - A genome-wide survey of highly expressed non-coding RNAs and biological
      validation of selected candidates in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e70720
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0070720 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that has the natural ability of
      delivering and integrating a piece of its own DNA into plant genome. Although
      bacterial non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been shown to regulate various biological
      processes including virulence, we have limited knowledge of how Agrobacterium
      ncRNAs regulate this unique inter-Kingdom gene transfer. Using whole
      transcriptome sequencing and an ncRNA search algorithm developed for this work,
      we identified 475 highly expressed candidate ncRNAs from A. tumefaciens C58,
      including 101 trans-encoded small RNAs (sRNAs), 354 antisense RNAs (asRNAs), 20
      5' untranslated region (UTR) leaders including a RNA thermosensor and 6
      riboswitches. Moreover, transcription start site (TSS) mapping analysis revealed 
      that about 51% of the mapped mRNAs have 5' UTRs longer than 60 nt, suggesting
      that numerous cis-acting regulatory elements might be encoded in the A.
      tumefaciens genome. Eighteen asRNAs were found on the complementary strands of
      virA, virB, virC, virD, and virE operons. Fifteen ncRNAs were induced and 7 were 
      suppressed by the Agrobacterium virulence (vir) gene inducer acetosyringone (AS),
      a phenolic compound secreted by the plants. Interestingly, fourteen of the
      AS-induced ncRNAs have putative vir box sequences in the upstream regions. We
      experimentally validated expression of 36 ncRNAs using Northern blot and Rapid
      Amplification of cDNA Ends analyses. We show functional relevance of two 5' UTR
      elements: a RNA thermonsensor (C1_109596F) that may regulate translation of the
      major cold shock protein cspA, and a thi-box riboswitch (C1_2541934R) that may
      transcriptionally regulate a thiamine biosynthesis operon, thiCOGG. Further
      studies on ncRNAs functions in this bacterium may provide insights and strategies
      that can be used to better manage pathogenic bacteria for plants and to improve
      Agrobacterum-mediated plant transformation.

TI  - Ectopic localization of auxin and cytokinin in tobacco seedlings by the
      plant-oncogenic AK-6b gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens AKE10.
PG  - 753-70
LID - 10.1007/s00425-013-1930-0 [doi]
AB  - The oncogenic 6b gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces a number of
      morphological and metabolic alterations in plants. Although molecular functions
      associated with the 6b genes have been proposed, including auxin transport, sugar
      transport, transcriptional regulation, and miRNA metabolism, so far an
      unequivocal conclusion has not been obtained. We investigated the association
      between auxin accumulation and tumor development of the tobacco seedlings
      expressing the AK-6b gene under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible
      promoter. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) localization was examined by immunochemical 
      staining with monoclonal antibody against IAA and by histochemical analysis using
      the IAA-specific induced construct, DR5::GUS (beta-glucuronidase). Both
      procedures indicated that IAA preferentially accumulated in the tumorous
      protrusions as well as in newly developing vascular bundles in the tumors.
      Furthermore, true leaves also showed abaxial IAA localization, leading to altered
      leaves in which the adaxial and abaxial identities were no longer evident.
      Co-localization of cytokinin and auxin in the abaxial tumors was verified by
      immunochemical staining with an antibody against cytokinin. Treatment of
      AK-6b-seedlings with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an inhibitor of polar auxin
      transport, promoted the morphological severity of phenotypes, whereas
      1-naphthoxyacetic acid, a specific auxin influx carrier inhibitor, induced tumor 
      regression on cotyledons and new tumorous proliferations on hypocotyls. Prominent
      accumulation of both auxin and cytokinin was observed in both regressed and newly
      developing tumors. We suggest from these results that modulation of
      auxin/cytokinin localization as a result of AK-6b gene expression is responsible 
      for the tumorous proliferation.

AB  - The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter of the food yeast Candida
      utilis strain NRRL Y-660 was cloned to create a novel integrative vector for
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The new binary vector harbors 
      beta-glucuronidase activity as reporter and kanamicin/geneticin resistance as
      selection marker. Recombinant clones of A. tumefaciens show kanamycin resistance 
      and high beta-glucuronidase activity under the control of the C. utilis promoter.
      This finding can be explained by the presence of a prokaryotic core in the yeast 
      promoter, predicted by in silico analysis of the sequence. This is the first
      report about functionality of a yeast promoter in A. tumefaciens.

TI  - Genetic analysis of Agrobacterium tumefaciens unipolar polysaccharide production 
      reveals complex integrated control of the motile-to-sessile switch.
PG  - 929-48
LID - 10.1111/mmi.12321 [doi]
AB  - Many bacteria colonize surfaces and transition to a sessile mode of growth. The
      plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens produces a unipolar polysaccharide (UPP)
      adhesin at single cell poles that contact surfaces. Here we report that elevated 
      levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)
      lead to surface-contact-independent UPP production and a red colony phenotype due
      to production of UPP and the exopolysaccharide cellulose, when A. tumefaciens is 
      incubated with the polysaccharide stain Congo Red. Transposon mutations with
      elevated Congo Red staining identified presumptive UPP-negative regulators,
      mutants for which were hyperadherent, producing UPP irrespective of surface
      contact. Multiple independent mutations were obtained in visN and visR,
      activators of flagellar motility in A. tumefaciens, now found to inhibit UPP and 
      cellulose production. Expression analysis in a visR mutant and isolation of
      suppressor mutations, identified three diguanylate cyclases inhibited by VisR.
      Null mutations for two of these genes decrease attachment and UPP production, but
      do not alter cellular c-di-GMP levels. However, analysis of catalytic site
      mutants revealed their GGDEF motifs are required to increase UPP production and
      surface attachment. Mutations in a specific presumptive c-di-GMP
      phosphodiesterase also elevate UPP production and attachment, consistent with
      c-di-GMP activation of surface-dependent adhesin deployment.

AB  - Glycogen and starch, the major storage carbohydrate in most living organisms,
      result mainly from the action of starch or glycogen synthases (SS or GS,
      respectively, EC 2.4.1.21). SSIII from Arabidopsis thaliana is an SS isoform with
      a particular modular organization: the C-terminal highly conserved
      glycosyltransferase domain is preceded by a unique specific region (SSIII-SD)
      which contains three in tandem starch binding domains (SBDs, named D1, D2 and D3)
      characteristic of polysaccharide degrading enzymes. N-terminal SBDs have a probed
      regulatory role in SSIII activity, showing starch binding ability and modulating 
      the catalytic properties of the enzyme. On the other hand, GS from Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens has a simple primary structure organization, characterized only by
      the highly conserved glycosyltransferase domain and lacking SBDs. To further
      investigate the functional role of A. thaliana SSIII-SD, three chimeric proteins 
      were constructed combining the SBDs from A. thaliana with the GS from A.
      tumefaciens. Recombinant proteins were expressed in and purified to homogeneity
      from Escherichia coli cells in order to be kinetically characterized.
      Furthermore, we tested the ability to restore in vivo glycogen biosynthesis in
      transformed E. coli glgA(-) cells, deficient in GS. Results show that the D3-GS
      chimeric enzyme showed increased capacity of glycogen synthesis in vivo with
      minor changes in its kinetics parameters compared to GS.

TI  - Large deletions in the pAtC58 megaplasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens can confer
      reduced carriage cost and increased expression of virulence genes.
PG  - 1353-64
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evt095 [doi]
AB  - The accessory plasmid pAtC58 of the common laboratory strain of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens confers numerous catabolic functions and has been proposed to play a 
      role in virulence. Genomic sequencing of evolved laboratory strains of A.
      tumefaciens revealed the presence of multiple deletion events in the At plasmid, 
      with reductions in plasmid size ranging from 25% to 30% (115-194 kb). Flanking
      both ends of the sites of these deletions is a short-nucleotide repeat sequence
      that is in a single copy in the deleted plasmids, characteristic of a phage- or
      transposon-mediated deletion event. This repeat sequence is widespread throughout
      the C58 genome, but concentrated on the At plasmid, suggesting its frequency to
      be nonrandom. In this study, we assess the prevalence of the larger of these
      deletions in multiple C58 derivatives and characterize its functional
      significance. We find that in addition to elevating virulence gene expression,
      this deletion is associated with a significantly reduced carriage cost to the
      cell. These observations are a clear demonstration of the dynamic nature of the
      bacterial genome and suggest a mechanism for genetic plasticity of these costly
      but otherwise stable plasmids. Additionally, this phenomenon could be the basis
      for some of the dramatic recombination events so ubiquitous within and among
      megaplasmids.

TI  - The thuEFGKAB operon of rhizobia and agrobacterium tumefaciens codes for
      transport of trehalose, maltitol, and isomers of sucrose and their assimilation
      through the formation of their 3-keto derivatives.
PG  - 3797-807

AB  - The thu operon (thuEFGKAB) in Sinorhizobium meliloti codes for transport and
      utilization functions of the disaccharide trehalose. Sequenced genomes of members
      of the Rhizobiaceae reveal that some rhizobia and Agrobacterium possess the
      entire thu operon in similar organizations and that Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099
      lacks the transport (thuEFGK) genes. In this study, we show that this operon is
      dedicated to the transport and assimilation of maltitol and isomers of sucrose
      (leucrose, palatinose, and trehalulose) in addition to trehalulose, not only in
      S. meliloti but also in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. By using genetic
      complementation, we show that the thuAB genes of S. meliloti, M. loti, and A.
      tumefaciens are functionally equivalent. Further, we provide both genetic and
      biochemical evidence to show that these bacteria assimilate these disaccharides
      by converting them to their respective 3-keto derivatives and that the thuAB
      genes code for this ketodisaccharide-forming enzyme(s). Formation of
      3-ketotrehalose in real time in live S. meliloti is shown through Raman
      spectroscopy. The presence of an additional ketodisaccharide-forming pathway(s)
      in A. tumefaciens is also indicated. To our knowledge, this is the first report
      to identify the genes that code for the conversion of disaccharides to their
      3-ketodisaccharide derivatives in any organism.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation of Salix matsudana
      Koidz. using mature seeds.
PG  - 628-39
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpt038 [doi]
AB  - An Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method was developed for
      Salix matsudana Koidz. using mature seeds as starting material. Multiple shoots
      were induced directly from embryonic shoot apices of germinating seeds. Although 
      thidiazuron, 6-benzylaminopurine and zeatin induced multiple shoot induction with
      high frequency, zeatin (4.5 muM) was more effective for elongation of shoots and 
      roots. The binary vector pCAMBIA1303, which contained neomycin phosphotransferase
      as a selectable marker gene and beta-glucuronidase as a reporter gene, was used
      for transformation. Factors affecting transformation efficiency were examined for
      optimization of the procedure. Up to 35 of 180 seeds regenerated
      kanamycin-resistant shoots under optimal transformation conditions as follows:
      seeds were precultured for 4 days, apices of embryonic shoots were removed and
      infected with A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 grown to a cell density equivalent
      (OD600) of 0.6, and then the infected explants were cultivated at 21 degrees C
      for 4 days. Storage of seeds at -20 degrees C for as long as 3 years had no
      significant effect on the induction of kanamycin-resistant shoots. Using this
      method, transgenic plants were obtained within approximately 5 months with a
      transformation frequency of 7.2%. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      showed that 36.4-93.8% of plants from all 13 tested kanamycin-resistant lines
      were PCR positive. Several 'escapes' were eliminated by a second round of
      selection. PCR, Southern blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses of selected 
      transgenic individuals 2 years after cutting propagation confirmed the successful
      generation of stable transformants. Our method, which minimizes the duration of
      axenic culture, may provide an alternative procedure for transformation of other 
      recalcitrant Salix species.

AB  - KEY MESSAGE: An efficient, reproducible and genotype-independent in planta
      transformation has been standardized for sugarcane using seed as explant.
      Transgenic sugarcane production through Agrobacterium infection followed by in
      vitro regeneration is a time-consuming process and highly genotype dependent. To 
      obtain more number of transformed sugarcane plants in a relatively short
      duration, sugarcane seeds were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105
      harboring pCAMBIA 1304-bar and transformed plants were successfully established
      without undergoing in vitro regeneration. Various factors affecting sugarcane
      seed transformation were optimized, including pre-culture duration,
      acetosyringone concentration, surfactants, co-cultivation, sonication and vacuum 
      infiltration duration. The transformed sugarcane plants were selected against
      BASTA((R)) and screened by GUS and GFP visual assay, PCR and Southern
      hybridization. Among the different combinations and concentrations tested, when
      12-h pre-cultured seeds were sonicated for 10 min and 3 min vacuum infiltered in 
      100 microM acetosyringone and 0.1 % Silwett L-77 containing Agrobacterium
      suspension and co-cultivated for 72-h showed highest transformation efficiency.
      The amenability of the standardized protocol was tested on five genotypes. It was
      found that all the tested genotypes responded favorably, though CoC671 proved to 
      be the best responding cultivar with 45.4 % transformation efficiency. The
      developed protocol is cost-effective, efficient and genotype independent without 
      involvement of any tissue culture procedure and can generate a relatively large
      number of transgenic plants in approximately 2 months.

TI  - Dynamic FtsA and FtsZ localization and outer membrane alterations during polar
      growth and cell division in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 9060-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1307241110 [doi]
AB  - Growth and cell division in rod-shaped bacteria have been primarily studied in
      species that grow predominantly by peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis along the length 
      of the cell. Rhizobiales species, however, predominantly grow by PG synthesis at 
      a single pole. Here we characterize the dynamic localization of several
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens components during the cell cycle. First, the lipophilic
      dye FM 4-64 predominantly stains the outer membranes of old poles versus growing 
      poles. In cells about to divide, however, both poles are equally labeled with FM 
      4-64, but the constriction site is not. Second, the cell-division protein FtsA
      alternates from unipolar foci in the shortest cells to unipolar and midcell
      localization in cells of intermediate length, to strictly midcell localization in
      the longest cells undergoing septation. Third, the cell division protein FtsZ
      localizes in a cell-cycle pattern similar to, but more complex than, FtsA.
      Finally, because PG synthesis is spatially and temporally regulated during the
      cell cycle, we treated cells with sublethal concentrations of carbenicillin (Cb) 
      to assess the role of penicillin-binding proteins in growth and cell division.
      Cb-treated cells formed midcell circumferential bulges, suggesting that
      interrupted PG synthesis destabilizes the septum. Midcell bulges contained bands 
      or foci of FtsA-GFP and FtsZ-GFP and no FM 4-64 label, as in untreated cells.
      There were no abnormal morphologies at the growth poles in Cb-treated cells,
      suggesting unipolar growth uses Cb-insensitive PG synthesis enzymes.

TI  - [Genetic transformation of Pinellia ternata with Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated sHSP genes].
PG  - 3758-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish an efficient genetic transformation system of Pinellia
      ternata. METHOD: With petioles from test-tube seedlings of P. ternata as
      explants, Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediation method was adopted to explore the
      effect of phenolic substances, A. tumefaciens's concentration, infection time,
      pre-incubation time and co-cultivation time on genetic transformation efficiency 
      of P. ternata. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The genetic transformation efficiency could
      be effectively enhanced by infecting in A. tumefaciens culture containing AS 40
      mg x L(-1) for 15 min for three days. The petioles were put into the
      differentiation medium containing 150 mg x L(-1) Kan and 350 mg x L(-1) Carb to
      screening and cultivation. After around 30 days, microtubers could be observed at
      both sides of the petioles. Gus staining and PCR verification on the regenerated 
      plants showed that the exogenous gene sHSP had been integrated into genome of P. 
      ternata.

TI  - First Report of Crown Gall, Caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens on Soapberry
      (Sapindus delavayi) in China.
PG  - 685
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-10-12-0988-PDN [doi]
AB  - Soapberry (Sapindus delavayi (Franch.) Radlk.,) plants are widely grown as shade 
      trees in the subtropical to tropical regions of China. In July 2011, large,
      aerial galls were observed on the above-ground trunks of 5-year-old soapberry
      plants in two commercial nursery gardens located in Zhejiang Province. Disease
      incidence was estimated to be 75%. The galls varied in weight from 2 to 24 g and 
      in texture from soft and spongy to hard, and in some cases, the galls completely 
      girdled the trunk. The trees with galls exhibited poor growth compared with
      healthy trees. Isolations from the grinded and macerated galls yielded nearly
      pure white, circular, and glistening bacterial colonies on Roy Sauer medium (2). 
      Six random colonies from different galls were selected for bacterial
      identification, and showed the same morphological, physiological, and biochemical
      characters and 16S rDNA sequences. All six isolates (isolate SD01 to SD06) were
      gram negative, rod-shaped bacteria. Carbon source utilization testing with the
      Biolog GN Bacterial Identification System (version 3.50) confirmed the bacteria
      as Agrobacterium tumefaciens with a similarity of 0.90. The most-parsimonious
      tree from the maximum parsimony analysis (PHYLIP package, version 3.68, 500
      replicates) of bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequences showed that A. tumefaciens SD01 
      (GenBank Accession No. JX997939) clustered phylogenetically most closely (99.5%
      similarity) with A. tumefaciens C58 (AE007870.2). Pathogenicity was confirmed by 
      injecting 3- to 5-week old tomato and sunflower plants and 2-year-old soapberry
      with approximately 5 mul of the bacterial suspension (10(8) CFU/ml) in sterile,
      distilled water. Sterile distilled water was used as a negative control. Ten
      plants of each treatment were inoculated. Inoculated plants were then transferred
      to a greenhouse at 25 degrees C. Typical tumors developed at the inoculation
      sites on tomatoes and sunflower plants 3 weeks after inoculation and on soapberry
      6 weeks after inoculation. No symptoms were observed on the control plants. The
      bacteria that were readily reisolated from the inoculated plants exhibited the
      same morphological, physiological characters and 16S rDNA sequence as the
      original culture and were confirmed as A. tumefaciens, fulfilling Koch's
      postulates. A. tumefaciens is endemic to China and has a very wide host range
      (1). However, crown gall of soapberry has never been found in China and other
      countries. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. tumefaciens on
      soapberry plants in China. References: (1) M. A. Escobar and A. M. Dandekar.

AB  - This paper demonstrated the relative bactericidal activity of photoirradiated
      (6W-UV Torch, lambda > 340 nm and intensity = 0.64 mW/cm(2)) P25-TiO2
      nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanotubes for the killing of Gram-negative bacterium
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 for the first time. TiO2 nanorod (anatase) with
      length of 70-100 nm and diameter of 10-12 nm, and TiO2 nanotube with length of
      90-110 nm and diameter of 9-11 nm were prepared from P-25 Degussa TiO2 (size,
      30-50 nm) by hydrothermal method and compared their biocidal activity both in
      aqueous slurry and thin films. The mode of bacterial cell decomposition was
      analyzed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier
      transform-infrared (FT-IR), and K(+) ion leakage. The antimicrobial activity of
      photoirradiated TiO2 of different shapes was found to be in the order P25-TiO2 > 
      nanorod > nanotube which is reverse to their specific surface area as 54 < 79 <
      176 m(2) g(-1), evidencing that the highest activity of P25-TiO2 nanoparticles is
      not due to surface area as their crystal structure and surface morphology are
      entirely different. TiO2 thin films always exhibited less photoactivity as
      compared to its aqueous suspension under similar conditions of cell viability
      test. The changes in the bacterial surface morphology by UV-irradiated P25-TiO2
      nanoparticles was examined by TEM, oxidative degradation of cell components such 
      as proteins, carbohydrates, phospholipids, nucleic acids by FT-IR spectral
      analysis, and K(+) ion leakage (2.5 ppm as compared to 0.4 ppm for control
      culture) as a measure of loss in cell membrane permeability.

TI  - The Tzs protein and exogenous cytokinin affect virulence gene expression and
      bacterial growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 888-99
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-01-13-0020-R [doi]
AB  - The soil phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease in a
      wide range of plant species. The neoplastic growth at the infection sites is
      caused by transferring, integrating, and expressing transfer DNA (T-DNA) from A. 
      tumefaciens into plant cells. A trans-zeatin synthesizing (tzs) gene is located
      in the nopaline-type tumor-inducing plasmid and causes trans-zeatin production in
      A. tumefaciens. Similar to known virulence (Vir) proteins that are induced by the
      vir gene inducer acetosyringone (AS) at acidic pH 5.5, Tzs protein is highly
      induced by AS under this growth condition but also constitutively expressed and
      moderately upregulated by AS at neutral pH 7.0. We found that the promoter
      activities and protein levels of several AS-induced vir genes increased in the
      tzs deletion mutant, a mutant with decreased tumorigenesis and transient
      transformation efficiencies, in Arabidopsis roots. During AS induction and
      infection of Arabidopsis roots, the tzs deletion mutant conferred impaired
      growth, which could be rescued by genetic complementation and supplementing
      exogenous cytokinin. Exogenous cytokinin also repressed vir promoter activities
      and Vir protein accumulation in both the wild-type and tzs mutant bacteria with
      AS induction. Thus, the tzs gene or its product, cytokinin, may be involved in
      regulating AS-induced vir gene expression and, therefore, affect bacterial growth
      and virulence during A. tumefaciens infection.

TI  - The effect of a unique halide-stabilizing residue on the catalytic properties of 
      haloalkane dehalogenase DatA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
PG  - 3149-59
LID - 10.1111/febs.12238 [doi]
AB  - Haloalkane dehalogenases catalyze the hydrolysis of carbon-halogen bonds in
      various chlorinated, brominated and iodinated compounds. These enzymes have a
      conserved pair of halide-stabilizing residues that are important in substrate
      binding and stabilization of the transition state and the halide ion product via 
      hydrogen bonding. In all previously known haloalkane dehalogenases, these
      residues are either a pair of tryptophans or a tryptophan-asparagine pair. The
      newly-isolated haloalkane dehalogenase DatA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58
      (EC 3.8.1.5) possesses a unique halide-stabilizing tyrosine residue, Y109, in
      place of the conventional tryptophan. A variant of DatA with the Y109W mutation
      was created and the effects of this mutation on the structure and catalytic
      properties of the enzyme were studied using spectroscopy and pre-steady-state
      kinetic experiments. Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics calculations were 
      used to obtain a detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bonding patterns within the
      active sites of the wild-type and the mutant, as well as of the stabilization of 
      the ligands as the reaction proceeds. Fluorescence quenching experiments
      suggested that replacing the tyrosine with tryptophan improves halide binding by 
      3.7-fold, presumably as a result of the introduction of an additional hydrogen
      bond. Kinetic analysis revealed that the mutation affected the substrate
      specificity of the enzyme and reduced its K(0.5) for selected halogenated
      substrates by a factor of 2-4, without impacting the rate-determining hydrolytic 
      step. We conclude that DatA is the first natural haloalkane dehalogenase that
      stabilizes its substrate in the active site using only a single hydrogen bond,
      which is a new paradigm in catalysis by this enzyme family.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a stable transformation system of the thermophilic fungus
      Thermomyces lanuginosus for its insertional mutagenesis. METHODS: Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was applied to establish
      transformation system of T. lanuginosus. Southern blotting of hph gene and
      cloning of transforming DNA (T-DNA) flanking sequences were used to determine
      insert number and site of T-DNA in the fungal genome, respectively. RESULTS: A
      reliable transformation method is established for T. lanuginosus. Specifically,
      pre-germinating spores of T. lanuginosus used at co-cultivated period was a
      prerequisite. T. lanuginosus germinating spores co-cultivated with Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens at 28 degrees C for 48 h achieved the highest transformation
      efficiency. Addition of Acetosyringone (AS) during pre-culture of A. tumefaciens 
      and co-cultivation of T. lanuginosus germinating spores with A. tumefaciens was
      essentially required, and the best results were obtained with AS at the
      concentration of 500 microM. Southern blotting analysis showed that majority of
      transformants (79.2%) contained a single insertion of T-DNA. Thermal asymmetric
      interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) analysis showed random insertion of T-DNA in the fungal
      genome. Using the transformation system, some stable phenotypic mutants of T.
      lanuginosus were obtained. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, a simple
      and efficient method for transforming T. lanuginosus by using ATMT. This approach
      provides a tool for insertional mutagenesis gene tagging in this thermophilic
      fungus.

TI  - In vivo analysis of DNA binding and ligand interaction of BlcR, an IclR-type
      repressor from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 814-822
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.065680-0 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens BlcR represses transcription of the blcABC operon,
      which is involved in metabolism of gamma-butyrolactone, and this repression is
      alleviated by succinate semialdehyde (SSA). BlcR exists as a homodimer, and the
      blcABC promoter DNA contains two BlcR-binding sites (IR1 and IR2) that correspond
      to two BlcR dimers. In this study, we established an in vivo system to examine
      the SSA-responsive control of BlcR transcriptional regulation. The endogenous
      blcR, encoded in the pAtC58 plasmid of A. tumefaciens C58, was not optimal for
      investigating the effect of SSA on BlcR repression, probably due to the SSA
      degradation mediated by the pAt-encoded blcABC. We therefore introduced blcR (and
      the blcABC promoter DNA, separately) exogenously into a strain of C58 cured of
      pAtC58 (and pTiC58). We applied this system to interrogate BlcR-DNA interactions 
      and to test predictions from our prior structural and biochemical studies. This
      in vivo analysis confirmed the previously mapped SSA-binding site and supported a
      model by which DNA coordinates formation of a BlcR tetramer. In addition, we
      identified a specific lysine residue (K59) as an important determinant for DNA
      binding. Moreover, based on isothermal titration calorimetry analysis, we found
      IR1 to play the dominant role in binding to BlcR, relative to IR2. Together,
      these in vivo results expand the biochemical findings and provide new mechanistic
      insights into BlcR-DNA interactions.

TI  - Coordination of division and development influences complex multicellular
      behavior in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e56682
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056682 [doi]
AB  - The alpha-Proteobacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens has proteins homologous to
      known regulators that govern cell division and development in Caulobacter
      crescentus, many of which are also conserved among diverse alpha-Proteobacteria. 
      In light of recent work demonstrating similarity between the division cycle of C.
      crescentus and that of A. tumefaciens, the functional conservation for this
      presumptive control pathway was examined. In C. crescentus the CtrA response
      regulator serves as the master regulator of cell cycle progression and cell
      division. CtrA activity is controlled by an integrated pair of multi-component
      phosphorelays: PleC/DivJ-DivK and CckA-ChpT-CtrA. Although several of the
      conserved orthologues appear to be essential in A. tumefaciens, deletions in pleC
      or divK were isolated and resulted in cell division defects, diminished swimming 
      motility, and a decrease in biofilm formation. A. tumefaciens also has two
      additional pleC/divJhomologue sensor kinases called pdhS1 and pdhS2, absent in C.
      crescentus. Deletion of pdhS1 phenocopied the DeltapleC and DeltadivK mutants.
      Cells lacking pdhS2 morphologically resembled wild-type bacteria, but were
      decreased in swimming motility and elevated for biofilm formation, suggesting
      that pdhS2 may serve to regulate the motile to non-motile switch in A.
      tumefaciens. Genetic analysis suggests that the PleC/DivJ-DivK and CckA-ChpT-CtrA
      phosphorelays in A. tumefaciens are vertically-integrated, as in C. crescentus. A
      gain-of-function mutation in CckA (Y674D) was identified as a spontaneous
      suppressor of the DeltapleC motility phenotype. Thus, although the core
      architecture of the A. tumefaciens pathway resembles that of C. crescentus there 
      are specific differences including additional regulators, divergent pathway
      architecture, and distinct target functions.

AB  - A protocol for the efficient genetic transformation of licorice (Glycyrrhiza
      inflata Batalin) cells in suspension culture using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated T-DNA delivery is described. G. inflata cells in suspension 
      culture were infected with A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harbouring the binary
      vector pCAMBIA1303, which contains the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and
      a hygromycin resistance gene (hpt II), respectively, under the transcriptional
      control of the CaMV35S promoter. Optimal transformation efficiency was achieved
      with an A. tumefaciens suspension having an OD600 of 0.4 and a period of 24 h of 
      co-cultivation with 3-day-old cells in a medium supplemented with 200 microM
      acetosyringone. The transgenic cell lines have been maintained in suspension
      subculture for 5 months. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the stable
      integration of transgenes into the G. inflata genome. The introduced genes had no
      discernable effect on cell growth or accumulation of total licorice flavonoids in
      the transgenic cell lines. This study provides the basis for the development of
      transgenic G. inflata cells.

AB  - Setosphaeria turcica, a hemibiotrophic pathogenic dothideomycete, is the causal
      agent of Northern Leaf Blight of maize, which periodically causes significant
      yield losses worldwide. To explore molecular mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity
      and virulence to the host, an efficient targeted gene knockout transformation
      system using Agrobacterium tumefaciens was established with field collected
      strains. The starting materials, incubation time, induction medium type,
      Agrobacterium cell density, and method of co-incubation were optimized for
      deletion of 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase, a gene in the melanin
      biosynthesis pathway, as a test case. Four additional genes were deleted in two
      different S. turcica field isolates to confirm robustness of the method. One of
      these mutant strains was reduced in virulence compared with the wild-type strain 
      when inoculated on susceptible maize. Transformation efficiency was approximately
      20 +/- 3 transformants per 1x 10(6) germlings and homologous recombination
      efficiency was 33.3 to 100%.

AB  - Plant-beneficial effects of bacteria are often underestimated, especially for
      well-studied strains associated with pathogenicity or originating from other
      environments. We assessed the impact of seed inoculation with the emblematic
      bacterial models Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (plasmid-cured) or Escherichia
      coli K-12 on maize seedlings in nonsterile soil. Compared with the noninoculated 
      control, root biomass (with A. tumefaciens or E. coli) and shoot biomass (with A.
      tumefaciens) were enhanced at 10 days for 'PR37Y15' but not 'DK315', as found
      with the phytostimulator Azospirillum brasilense UAP-154 (positive control). In
      roots as well as in shoots, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and E. coli triggered
      similar (in PR37Y15) or different (in DK315) changes in the high-performance
      liquid chromatography profiles of secondary metabolites (especially
      benzoxazinoids), distinct from those of Azospirillum brasilense UAP-154. Genome
      sequence analysis revealed homologs of nitrite reductase genes nirK and nirBD and
      siderophore synthesis genes for Agrobacterium tumefaciens, as well as homologs of
      nitrite reductase genes nirBD and phosphatase genes phoA and appA in E. coli,
      whose contribution to phytostimulation will require experimental assessment. In
      conclusion, the two emblematic bacterial models had a systemic impact on maize
      secondary metabolism and resulted in unexpected phytostimulation of seedlings in 
      the Azospirillum sp.-responsive cultivar.

      round of selection. Bacterial concentration of OD(600) = 0.6 served as an optimal
      concentration for infection and the transformation efficiency was significantly
      higher of about 46.28 %. In another set of experiment, an improved and stable
      regeneration system was adapted for the explants from the selection medium.
      Four-day-old double cotyledonary nodal explants were excised from the
      microinjected seedlings and cultured onto the MS medium supplemented with 1.5 mg 
      L(-1) thidiazuron, 1.5 mg L(-1) indole-3-butyric acid, 30 mg L(-1) kanamycin, and
      0-1.5 mg L(-1) adenine sulphate. Maximum of 9 out of 13 micropropagated shoots
      were shown positive to GUS assay. By this technique, the transformation
      efficiency was increased from 46.28 to 65.90 %. Thus, this paper reports the
      successful protocol for the mass production of transformants using microinjection
      and micropropagation techniques.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens recognizes its host environment using ChvE to bind
      diverse plant sugars as virulence signals.
PG  - 678-83
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1215033110 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a broad host range plant pathogen that
      combinatorially recognizes diverse host molecules including phenolics, low pH,
      and aldose monosaccharides to activate its pathogenic pathways. Chromosomal
      virulence gene E (chvE) encodes a periplasmic-binding protein that binds several 
      neutral sugars and sugar acids, and subsequently interacts with the VirA/VirG
      regulatory system to stimulate virulence (vir) gene expression. Here, a
      combination of genetics, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal calorimetry
      reveals how ChvE binds the different monosaccharides and also shows that binding 
      of sugar acids is pH dependent. Moreover, the potency of a sugar for vir gene
      expression is modulated by a transport system that also relies on ChvE. These two
      circuits tune the overall system to respond to sugar concentrations encountered
      in vivo. Finally, using chvE mutants with restricted sugar specificities, we show
      that there is host variation in regard to the types of sugars that are limiting
      for vir induction.

      and its application in molecular breeding.

AB  - Lipase produced by Penicillium expansum is widely used in laundry detergent and
      leather industry; however, the absence of an efficient transformation technology 
      sets a major obstacle for further enhancement of its lipase productivity through 
      advanced gene engineering. In this work, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation (ATMT) was investigated for P. expansum PE-12 transformation,
      using hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) as a selectable marker gene. As a
      result, we revealed that the frequency of transformation surpassed 100
      transformants/10(5)condida, most of the integrated T-DNA appeared as a single
      copy at a random position in chromosomal DNA, and all the transformants showed
      mitotic stability. Facilitated by this newly established method, for the first
      time, P. expansum PE-12 was genetically engineered to improve the lipase yield,
      through a homologous expression vector carrying the endogenous lipase gene (PEL) 
      driven by the strong constitutive promoter of the glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
      dehydrogenase gene (gpdA) from Aspergillus nidulans. The highest expression level
      of the engineered strain reached up to 1700 U/mL, nearly 2-fold of the original
      industrial strain (900 U/mL). Our reproducible ATMT system has not only revealed 
      the great potential of homologous expression-directed genetic engineering, which 
      is more efficient and specific compared to traditional mutagenesis, but also
      provided new possibilities and perspectives for any other practical applications 
      of P. expansum-related genetic engineering in the future.

PG  - tpc.112.tt1012
LID - 10.1105/tpc.112.tt1012 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria of the genus Agrobacterium are very useful and unusual plant pathogens. 
      Through a rare inter-kingdom DNA transfer, the bacteria move some of their genes 
      into their host's genome, thereby inducing the host cells to proliferate and
      produce opines, nutrients sources for the pathogen. Agrobacterium's ability to
      transfer DNA makes can be adapted to introduce other genes, such as those
      encoding useful traits, into plant genomes. The development of Agrobacterium as a
      tool to transform plants is a landmark event in modern plant biology. This
      lecture provides an introduction to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and related
      species, focusing on their modes of pathogenicity, their usefulness as tools for 
      plant transformation, and their use as a model for the study of plant-pathogen
      interactions.

TI  - One out of four: HspL but no other small heat shock protein of Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens acts as efficient virulence-promoting VirB8 chaperone.
PG  - e49685
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0049685 [doi]
AB  - Alpha-crystallin-type small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitously
      distributed in most eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Four sHsp genes named hspL, hspC,
      hspAT1, and hspAT2 were identified in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a plant
      pathogenic bacterium capable of unique interkingdom DNA transfer via type IV
      secretion system (T4SS). HspL is highly expressed in virulence-induced growth
      condition and functions as a VirB8 chaperone to promote T4SS-mediated DNA
      transfer. Here, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the
      involvement of the other three sHsps in T4SS and discovered the molecular basis
      underlying the dominant function of HspL in promoting T4SS function. While single
      deletion of hspL but no other sHsp gene reduced T4SS-mediated DNA transfer and
      tumorigenesis efficiency, additional deletion of other sHsp genes in the hspL
      deletion background caused synergistic effects in the virulence phenotypes. This 
      is correlated with the high induction of hspL and only modest increase of hspC,
      hspAT1, and hspAT2 at their mRNA and protein abundance in virulence-induced
      growth condition. Interestingly, overexpression of any single sHsp gene alone in 
      the quadruple mutant caused increased T4SS-mediated DNA transfer and
      tumorigenesis. Thermal aggregation protecting assays in vitro indicated that all 
      four sHsps exhibit chaperone activity for the model substrate citrate synthase
      but only HspL functions as efficient chaperone for VirB8. The higher VirB8
      chaperone activity of HspL was also demonstrated in vivo, in which lower amounts 
      of HspL than other sHsps were sufficient in maintaining VirB8 homeostasis in A.
      tumefaciens. Domain swapping between HspL and HspAT2 indicated that N-terminal,
      central alpha-crystallin, and C-terminal domains of HspL all contribute to HspL
      function as an efficient VirB8 chaperone. Taken together, we suggest that the
      dominant role of HspL in promoting T4SS function is based on its higher
      expression in virulence-induced condition and its more efficient VirB8 chaperone 
      activity as compared to other sHsps.

TI  - Development of an efficient transformation method by Agrobacterium tumefaciens

      strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using NPTII selection.

AB  - KEY MESSAGE : We developed an efficient Agrobacterium -mediated transformation
      method using an Ac/Ds transposon tagging construct for F. vesca and high
      throughput paromomycin spray assay to identify its transformants for strawberry
      functional genomics. Genomic resources for Rosaceae species are now readily
      available, including the Fragaria vesca genome, EST sequences, markers, linkage
      maps, and physical maps. The Rosaceae Genomic Executive Committee has promoted
      strawberry as a translational genomics model due to its unique biological
      features and transformability for fruit trait improvement. Our overall research
      goal is to use functional genomic and metabolic approaches to pursue high
      throughput gene discovery in the diploid woodland strawberry. F. vesca offers
      several advantages of a fleshy fruit typical of most fruit crops, short life
      cycle (seed to seed in 12-16 weeks), small genome size (206 Mbb/C), small plant
      size, self-compatibility, and many seeds per plant. We have developed an
      efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated strawberry transformation method
      using kanamycin selection, and high throughput paromomycin spray assay to
      efficiently identify transgenic strawberry plants. Using our kanamycin
      transformation method, we were able to produce up to 98 independent kanamycin
      resistant insertional mutant lines using a T-DNA construct carrying an Ac/Ds
      transposon Launchpad system from a single transformation experiment involving
      inoculation of 22 leaf explants of F. vesca accession 551572 within approx. 11
      weeks (from inoculation to soil). Transgenic plants with 1-2 copies of a
      transgene were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Using our paromomycin spray
      assay, transgenic F. vesca plants were rapidly identified within 10 days after
      spraying.

TI  - Phosphorus limitation increases attachment in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and
      reveals a conditional functional redundancy in adhesin biosynthesis.
PG  - 674-84

LID - S0923-2508(12)00158-1 [pii]
AB  - Bacterial responses to phosphorus limitation, commonly inorganic phosphate
      (P(i)), are important survival mechanisms in a variety of environments. The
      two-component sensor kinase PhoR and its cognate response regulator PhoB are
      central to the P(i) limitation response of many bacteria and control the large
      Pho regulon. Limitation for P(i) significantly increased attachment and biofilm
      formation by the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and this was driven by
      PhoB. Surprisingly, it was also found that both phoR and phoB were essential in
      A. tumefaciens. Expression of a plasmid-borne copy of the low affinity P(i)
      transporter (pit) from Sinorhizobium meliloti in A. tumefaciens abolished the
      phoB and phoR essentiality in A. tumefaciens and allowed direct demonstration of 
      the requirement for this regulatory system in the biofilm response. Increased
      attachment under P(i) limitation required a unipolar polysaccharide (UPP)
      adhesin. Mutation of a polyisoprenylphosphate hexose-1-phosphate transferase
      (PHPT) called uppE abolished UPP production and prevented surface attachment
      under P(i)-replete conditions, but this was rescued under P(i) limitation, and
      this rescue required phoB. In low P(i) conditions, either uppE or a paralogous
      gene Atu0102 is functionally redundant, but only uppE functions in UPP synthesis 
      and attachment when P(i) is replete. This conditional functional redundancy
      illustrates the influence of phosphorus availability on A. tumefaciens surface
      colonization.

TI  - Evaluation of four Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains for the genetic
      transformation of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cultivar Micro-Tom.
PG  - 239-47
LID - 10.1007/s00299-012-1358-1 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE : Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains differ not only in their ability 
      to transform tomato Micro-Tom, but also in the number of transgene copies that
      the strains integrate in the genome. The transformation efficiency of tomato
      (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. Micro-Tom with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains
      AGL1, EHA105, GV3101, and MP90, harboring the plasmid pBI121 was compared. The
      presence of the nptII and/or uidA transgenes in regenerated T(0) plants was
      determined by PCR, Southern blotting, and/or GUS histochemical analyses. In
      addition, a rapid and reliable duplex, qPCR TaqMan assay was standardized to
      estimate transgene copy number. The highest transformation rate (65 %) was
      obtained with the Agrobacterium strain GV3101, followed by EHA105 (40 %), AGL1
      (35 %), and MP90 (15 %). The mortality rate of cotyledons due to Agrobacterium
      overgrowth was the lowest with the strain GV3101. The Agrobacterium strain EHA105
      was more efficient than GV3101 in the transfer of single T-DNA insertions of
      nptII and uidA transgenes into the tomato genome. Even though Agrobacterium
      strain MP90 had the lowest transformation rate of 15 %, the qPCR analysis showed 
      that the strain MP90 was the most efficient in the transfer of single transgene
      insertions, and none of the transgenic plants produced with this strain had more 
      than two insertion events in their genome. The combination of higher
      transformation efficiency and fewer transgene insertions in plants transformed
      using EHA105 makes this Agrobacterium strain optimal for functional genomics and 
      biotechnological applications in tomato.

TI  - Metabolic modeling of denitrification in Agrobacterium tumefaciens: a tool to
      study inhibiting and activating compounds for the denitrification pathway.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00370 [doi]
AB  - A metabolic network model for facultative denitrification was developed based on 
      experimental data obtained with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The model includes
      kinetic regulation at the enzyme level and transcription regulation at the enzyme
      synthesis level. The objective of this work was to study the key factors
      regulating the metabolic response of the denitrification pathway to transition
      from oxic to anoxic respiration and to find parameter values for the biological
      processes that were modeled. The metabolic model was used to test hypotheses that
      were formulated based on the experimental results and offers a structured look on
      the processes that occur in the cell during transition in respiration. The main
      phenomena that were modeled are the inhibition of the cytochrome c oxidase by
      nitric oxide (NO) and the (indirect) inhibition of oxygen on the denitrification 
      enzymes. The activation of transcription of nitrite reductase and NO reductase by
      their respective substrates were hypothesized. The general assumption that
      nitrite and NO reduction are controlled interdependently to prevent NO
      accumulation does not hold for A. tumefaciens. The metabolic network model was
      demonstrated to be a useful tool for unraveling the different factors involved in
      the complex response of A. tumefaciens to highly dynamic environmental
      conditions.

AB  - Here we characterize the first step in methionine biosynthesis in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, an alpha-proteobacterium. We explored the metA gene and its products
      and found several unique properties. Although the gene was annotated as a
      homoserine transsuccinylase, based upon sequence similarity to characterized
      homologs in other bacteria, including Escherichia coli, the enzyme uses
      acetyl-CoA as a substrate and therefore is functionally a transacetylase.
      Moreover, the protein is thermolabile and the gene is under regulation of heat
      shock transcriptional activator sigma32. 3. The gene has a SAM-riboswitch, which 
      shuts off transcription by sigma-32 as well as by the vegetative sigma-70.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Phellodendron amurense Rupr.
      using mature-seed explants.

AB  - An efficient transformation protocol was developed for Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation of Phellodendron amurense Rupr. for using explants from mature
      seeds. The binary vector pCAMBIA1303, which contained hygromycin
      phosphotransferase (hptII) as a selectable marker gene and beta-glucuronidase
      (GUS) as a reporter gene, was used for transformation studies. Different factors 
      that affect survival of transformed buds, namely Agrobacterium infection method, 
      bacterial strain, pre-culture duration, acetosyringone concentration, co-culture 
      duration, and co-culture temperature were examined and optimized for
      transformation efficiency on the basis of GUS staining of hygromycin-resistant
      buds. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot and reverse transcription
      PCR confirmed the presence of the GUS gene. A transformation frequency of 13.1 % 
      was achieved under optimized conditions for transformation (A. tumefaciens strain
      EHA105, 4 days co-cultivation at 4 degrees C, and infection of the pre-cultured
      mature-seed explants for 2 days). This is the first report of a successful
      genetic transformation protocol for P. amurense.

TI  - Acid-induced type VI secretion system is regulated by ExoR-ChvG/ChvI signaling
      cascade in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - e1002938
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002938 [doi]
AB  - The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread, versatile protein secretion 
      system in pathogenic Proteobacteria. Several T6SSs are tightly regulated by
      various regulatory systems at multiple levels. However, the signals and/or
      regulatory mechanisms of many T6SSs remain unexplored. Here, we report on an
      acid-induced regulatory mechanism activating T6SS in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a
      plant pathogenic bacterium causing crown gall disease in a wide range of plants. 
      We monitored the secretion of the T6SS hallmark protein hemolysin-coregulated
      protein (Hcp) from A. tumefaciens and found that acidity is a T6SS-inducible
      signal. Expression analysis of the T6SS gene cluster comprising the imp and hcp
      operons revealed that imp expression and Hcp secretion are barely detected in A. 
      tumefaciens grown in neutral minimal medium but are highly induced with acidic
      medium. Loss- and gain-of-function analysis revealed that the A. tumefaciens T6SS
      is positively regulated by a chvG/chvI two-component system and negatively
      regulated by exoR. Further epistasis analysis revealed that exoR functions
      upstream of the chvG sensor kinase in regulating T6SS. ChvG protein levels are
      greatly increased in the exoR deletion mutant and the periplasmic form of
      overexpressed ExoR is rapidly degraded under acidic conditions. Importantly, ExoR
      represses ChvG by direct physical interaction, but disruption of the physical
      interaction allows ChvG to activate T6SS. The phospho-mimic but not wild-type
      ChvI response regulator can bind to the T6SS promoter region in vitro and
      activate T6SS with growth in neutral minimal medium. We present the first
      evidence of T6SS activation by an ExoR-ChvG/ChvI cascade and propose that acidity
      triggers ExoR degradation, thereby derepressing ChvG/ChvI to activate T6SS in A. 
      tumefaciens.

AB  - (R)-3-Quinuclidinol is a useful chiral building block for the synthesis of
      various pharmaceuticals and can be produced from 3-quinuclidinone by asymmetric
      reduction. A novel 3-quinuclidinone reductase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      (AtQR) catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of 3-quinuclidinone to
      (R)-3-quinuclidinol with NADH as a cofactor. Recombinant AtQR was overexpressed
      in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized with NADH using the sitting-drop
      vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. Crystals were obtained using a reservoir
      solution containing PEG 3350 as a precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were
      collected to 1.72 A resolution on beamline BL-5A at the Photon Factory. The
      crystal belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 62.0, b =
      126.4, c = 62.0 A, beta = 110.5 degrees , and was suggested to contain four
      molecules in the asymmetric unit (V(M) = 2.08 A(3) Da(-1)).

TI  - Role of Systemic Agrobacterium tumefaciens Populations in Crown Gall Incidence on

PG  - 1415-1421
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-11-0364-RE [doi]
AB  - Greater than 75% of English walnut production in the United States occurs on the 
      walnut rootstock Juglans hindsii x J. regia 'Paradox', which is highly
      susceptible to infection by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When seed were germinated 
      and grown in the presence of A. tumefaciens, in the absence of wounding, 94% of
      the seedlings exhibited tumors while 89% contained systemic A. tumefaciens
      populations. When seedlings were wound inoculated, A. tumefaciens established
      endophytic populations in stem tissue and often migrated from the site of
      infection. Distribution of A. tumefaciens in the stem was random and may exhibit 
      seasonal variation. A. tumefaciens populations in root tissue were more readily
      detected than in stem tissue and may serve as a reservoir for subsequent
      infection of the aerial portions of the tree. Importantly, 7% of inoculated,
      asymptomatic seedlings contained endophytic populations of A. tumefaciens. In
      all, 17% of seedlings inoculated as seeds developed galls at secondary stem-wound
      sites. These results provide an ecological and epidemiological foundation upon
      which to modify existing tree-handling practices in both nursery and orchard
      production environments to manage crown gall incidence.

AB  - Eleven proteins of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virB operon are required for
      type IV secretion. All octopine Ti-plasmid pTiA6NC VirB proteins, except VirB8,
      could be expressed from a cloned monocistronic gene. Accumulation of VirB8
      required translation of the upstream virB7 gene. Analysis of chimeric virB8 genes
      and a newly constructed virB7 deletion mutant Agrobacterium AD1275 showed that
      translation of virB7, and not the gene product, is required for VirB8
      accumulation. Agrobacterium AD1275 accumulated VirB8 and other downstream virB
      gene products, and could be complemented with only virB7 in trans. In
      monocistronic virB8, sequences upstream of the virB8 ORF negatively controls
      virB8 expression possibly through the formation of a secondary structure that
      occludes both the ribosome binding site and translation start codon. Disruption
      of the structure through translation of the upstream gene ensures efficient
      translation of the virB8 mRNA in wild type bacteria. The pTiA6NC virB8 contains
      two potential translation start sites within the first eight codons. We show that
      the first AUG is used for virB8 translation initiation. The seven N-terminal
      residues resulting from translation initiation at the first AUG are required for 
      both tumor formation and stabilization of VirB3. VirB8 and VirB4 are sufficient
      for the stabilization of VirB3, and VirB7 stabilizes VirB3 indirectly through its
      effect on virB8 expression.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 is a Gram-negative soil bacterium capable of
      inducing tumors (crown galls) on many dicotyledonous plants. The genome of A.
      tumefaciens strain C58 was re-annotated based on the Z-curve method. First, all
      the 'hypothetical genes' were re-identified, and 29 originally annotated
      'hypothetical genes' were recognized to be non-coding open reading frames (ORFs).
      Theoretical evidence obtained from principal component analysis, clusters of
      orthologous groups of proteins occupation, and average length distribution showed
      that these non-coding ORFs were highly unlikely to encode proteins. Results from 
      the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments on three
      different growth stages of A. tumefaciens C58 confirmed that 23 (79%) of the
      identified non-coding ORFs have no transcripts in these growth stages. In
      addition, using theoretical prediction, 19 potential protein-coding genes were
      predicted to be new protein-coding genes. Fifteen (79%) of these genes were
      verified with RT-PCR experiments. The RT-PCR experimental results confirmed the
      reliability of our theoretical prediction, indicating that false-positive
      prediction and missing genes always exist in the annotation of A. tumefaciens C58
      genome. The improved annotation will serve as a valuable resource for the
      research of the lifestyle, metabolism, and pathogenicity of A. tumefaciens C58.
      The re-annotation of A. tumefaciens C58 can be obtained from

AB  - Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step of the
      lysine-biosynthesis pathway in bacteria, plants and some fungi. This study
      describes the cloning, expression, purification and crystallization of DHDPS
      (NP_354047.1) from the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AgT-DHDPS).
      Enzyme-kinetics studies demonstrate that AgT-DHDPS possesses DHDPS activity in
      vitro. Crystals of AgT-DHDPS were grown in the unliganded form and in forms with 
      substrate bound and with substrate plus allosteric inhibitor (lysine) bound.
      X-ray diffraction data sets were subsequently collected to a maximum resolution
      of 1.40 A. Determination of the structure with and without substrate and
      inhibitor will offer insight into the design of novel pesticide agents.

TI  - Accumulation of glycolipids and other non-phosphorous lipids in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens grown under phosphate deprivation.
PG  - 69-80
LID - 10.1093/glycob/cws124 [doi]
AB  - Phosphate deficiency is characteristic for many natural habitats, resulting in
      different physiological responses in plants and bacteria including the
      replacement of phospholipids by glycolipids and other phosphorous-free lipids.
      The plant pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is free of
      glycolipids under full nutrition, harbors an open reading frame (ORF) coding for 
      a processive glycosyltransferase (named as Pgt). This glycosyltransferase was
      previously shown to synthesize glucosylgalactosyldiacylglycerol (GGD) and
      digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGD) after heterologous expression. The native
      function of this enzyme and the conditions for its activation remained unknown.
      We show here that Pgt is active under phosphate deprivation synthesizing GGD and 
      DGD in Agrobacterium. A corresponding deletion mutant (Deltapgt) is free of these
      two glycolipids. Glycolipid accumulation is mainly regulated by substrate
      (diacylglycerol) availability. Diacylglycerol and the total fatty acid pool are
      characterized by an altered acyl composition in dependence of the phosphate
      status with a strong decrease of 18:1 and concomitant increase of 19:0 cyclo
      during phosphate deprivation. Furthermore, Agrobacterium accumulates two
      additional unknown glycolipids and diacylglycerol trimethylhomoserine (DGTS)
      during phosphate deprivation. Accumulation of all these lipids is accompanied by 
      a reduction in phospholipids from 75 to 45% in the wild type. A further
      non-phosphorous lipid, ornithine lipid, was not increased but its degree of
      hydroxylation was elevated under phosphate deprivation. The lack of GGD and DGD
      in the Deltapgt mutant has no effect on growth and virulence of Agrobacterium,
      suggesting that these two lipids are functionally replaced by DGTS and the two
      unknown glycolipids under phosphate deprivation.

AB  - The Gram negative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens is uniquely capable of
      genetically transforming eukaryotic host cells during the infection process. DNA 
      and protein substrates are transferred into plant cells via a type IV secretion
      system (T4SS), which forms large cell-envelope spanning complexes at multiple
      sites around the bacterial circumference. To gain a detailed understanding of
      T4SS positioning, the spatial distribution of fluorescently labeled T4SS
      components was quantitatively assessed to distinguish between random and
      structured localization processes. Through deconvolution microscopy followed by
      Fourier analysis and modeling, T4SS foci were found to localize in a non-random
      periodic pattern. These results indicate that T4SS complexes are dependent on an 
      underlying scaffold or assembly process to obtain an organized distribution
      suitable for effective delivery of substrates into host cells.

PG  - 1321-8
LID - 10.1002/btpr.1608 [doi]
AB  - Attachment of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens to host plant cells is
      an early and necessary step in plant transformation and agroinfiltration
      processes. However, bacterial attachment behavior is not well understood in
      complex plant tissues. Here we developed an imaging-based method to observe and
      quantify A. tumefaciens attached to leaf tissue in situ. Fluorescent labeling of 
      bacteria with nucleic acid, protein, and vital dyes was investigated as a rapid
      alternative to generating recombinant strains expressing fluorescent proteins.
      Syto 16 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain was found to yield the greatest
      signal intensity in stained bacteria without affecting viability or infectivity. 
      Stained bacteria retained the stain and were detectable over 72 h. To demonstrate
      in situ detection of attached bacteria, confocal fluorescent microscopy was used 
      to image A. tumefaciens in sections of lettuce leaf tissue following
      vacuum-infiltration with labeled bacteria. Bacterial signals were associated with
      plant cell surfaces, suggesting detection of bacteria attached to plant cells.
      Bacterial attachment to specific leaf tissues was in agreement with known leaf
      tissue competencies for transformation with Agrobacterium. Levels of bacteria
      attached to leaf cells were quantified over time post-infiltration. Signals from 
      stained bacteria were stable over the first 24 h following infiltration but
      decreased in intensity as bacteria multiplied in planta. Nucleic acid staining of
      A. tumefaciens followed by confocal microscopy of infected leaf tissue offers a
      rapid, in situ method for evaluating attachment of A. tumefaciens' to plant
      expression hosts and a tool to facilitate management of transient expression
      processes via agroinfiltration.

      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 5209-17
LID - 10.1128/JB.00510-12 [doi]
AB  - The Hfq protein mediates gene regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) in about 50% of
      all bacteria. Depending on the species, phenotypic defects of an hfq mutant range
      from mild to severe. Here, we document that the purified Hfq protein of the plant
      pathogen and natural genetic engineer Agrobacterium tumefaciens binds to the
      previously described sRNA AbcR1 and its target mRNA atu2422, which codes for the 
      substrate binding protein of an ABC transporter taking up proline and
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several other ABC transporter components were
      overproduced in an hfq mutant compared to their levels in the parental strain,
      suggesting that Hfq plays a major role in controlling the uptake systems and
      metabolic versatility of A. tumefaciens. The hfq mutant showed delayed growth,
      altered cell morphology, and reduced motility. Although the DNA-transferring type
      IV secretion system was produced, tumor formation by the mutant strain was
      attenuated, demonstrating an important contribution of Hfq to plant
      transformation by A. tumefaciens.

AB  - The key amino acid residues that influence the function of the Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens iron response regulator protein (Irr(At) ) were investigated. Several
      Irr(At) mutant proteins containing substitutions in amino acids corresponding to 
      candidate metal- and haem-binding sites were constructed. The ability of the
      mutant proteins to repress the promoter of the membrane bound ferritin (mbfA)
      gene was investigated using a promoter-lacZ fusion assay. A single mutation at
      residue H94 significantly decreased the repressive activity of Irr(At) . Multiple
      mutation analysis revealed the importance of H45, H65, the HHH motif (H92, H93
      and H94) and H127 for the repressor function of Irr(At) . H94 is essential for
      the iron responsiveness of Irr(At) . Furthermore, the Irr(At) mutant proteins
      showed differential abilities to complement the H(2) O(2) -hyper-resistant
      phenotype of an irr mutant.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a unique plant pathogenic bacterium renowned for its
      ability to transform plants. The integration of transferred DNA (T-DNA) and the
      formation of complex insertions in the genome of transgenic plants during A.
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation are still poorly understood. Here, we show
      that complex extrachromosomal T-DNA structures form in A. tumefaciens-infected
      plants immediately after infection. Furthermore, these extrachromosomal complex
      DNA molecules can circularize in planta. We recovered circular T-DNA molecules
      (T-circles) using a novel plasmid-rescue method. Sequencing analysis of the
      T-circles revealed patterns similar to the insertion patterns commonly found in
      transgenic plants. The patterns include illegitimate DNA end joining, T-DNA
      truncations, T-DNA repeats, binary vector sequences, and other unknown "filler"
      sequences. Our data suggest that prior to T-DNA integration, a transferred
      single-stranded T-DNA is converted into a double-stranded form. We propose that
      termini of linear double-stranded T-DNAs are recognized and repaired by the
      plant's DNA double-strand break-repair machinery. This can lead to
      circularization, integration, or the formation of extrachromosomal complex T-DNA 
      structures that subsequently may integrate.

TI  - Efficient genetic transformation of Withania coagulans (Stocks) Dunal mediated by
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens from leaf explants of in vitro multiple shoot culture.
PG  - 451-8
LID - 10.1007/s00709-012-0428-0 [doi]
AB  - An efficient and reproducible Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of
      Withania coagulans was achieved using leaf explants of in vitro multiple shoot
      culture. The Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 harboring the binary vector pIG121Hm
      containing beta-glucuronidase gene (gusA) under the control of CaMV35S promoter
      was used in the development of transformation protocol. The optimal conditions
      for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of W. coagulans were found to be
      the co-cultivation of leaf explants for 20 min to agrobacterial inoculum (O.D.
      0.4) followed by 3 days of co-cultivation on medium supplemented with 100 muM
      acetosyringone. Shoot bud induction as well as differentiation occurred on
      Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 10.0 muM 6-benzylaminopurine, 8.0
      muM indole 3-acetic acid, and 50.0 mgl(-1) kanamycin after three consecutive
      cycles of selection. Elongated shoots were rooted using a two-step procedure
      involving root induction in a medium containing 2.5 muM indole 3-butyric acid for
      1 week and then transferred to hormone free one-half MS basal for 2 weeks. We
      were successful in achieving 100 % frequency of transient GUS expression with 5 %
      stable transformation efficiency using optimized conditions. PCR analysis of T0
      transgenic plants showed the presence of gusA and nptII genes confirming the
      transgenic event. Histochemical GUS expression was observed in the putative
      transgenic W. coagulans plants. Thin layer chromatography showed the presence of 
      similar type of withanolides in the transgenic and non-transgenic regenerated
      plants. A. tumefaciens mediated transformation system via leaf explants developed
      in this study will be useful for pathway manipulation using metabolic engineering
      for bioactive withanolides in W. coagulans, an important medicinal plant.

TI  - Development of efficient Catharanthus roseus regeneration and transformation
      system using agrobacterium tumefaciens and hypocotyls as explants.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/1472-6750-12-34 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a valuable medicinal plant, Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus
      roseus) produces many terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), such as vindoline,
      ajamlicine, serpentine, catharanthine, vinblastine and vincristine et al. Some of
      them are important components of drugs treating cancer and hypertension. However,
      the yields of these TIAs are low in wild-type plants, and the total chemical
      synthesis is impractical in large scale due to high-cost and their complicated
      structures. The recent development of metabolic engineering strategy offers a
      promising solution. In order to improve the production of TIAs in C. roseus, the 
      establishment of an efficient genetic transformation method is required. RESULTS:
      To develop a genetic transformation method for C. roseus, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens strain EHA105 was employed which harbors a binary vector pCAMBIA2301 
      containing a report beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and a selectable marker
      neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (NTPII). The influential factors were
      investigated systematically and the optimal transformation condition was achieved
      using hypocotyls as explants, including the sonication treatment of 10 min with
      80 W, A. tumefaciens infection of 30 min and co-cultivation of 2 d in 1/2 MS
      medium containing 100 muM acetosyringone. With a series of selection in callus,
      shoot and root inducing kanamycin-containing resistance media, we successfully
      obtained stable transgenic regeneration plants. The expression of GUS gene was
      confirmed by histochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and genomic southern blot
      analysis. To prove the efficiency of the established genetic transformation
      system, the rate-limiting gene in TIAs biosynthetic pathway, DAT, which encodes
      deacetylvindoline-4-O-acetyltransferase, was transferred into C. roseus using
      this established system and 9 independent transgenic plants were obtained. The
      results of metabolite analysis using high performance liquid chromatography
      (HPLC) showed that overexpression of DAT increased the yield of vindoline in
      transgenic plants. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we report an efficient
      Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for C. roseus plants with 11% of
      transformation frequency. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the
      establishment of A. tumefaciens mediated transformation and regeneration of C.
      roseus. More importantly, the C. roseus transformation system developed in this
      work was confirmed in the successful transformation of C. roseus using a key gene
      DAT involved in TIAs biosynthetic pathway resulting in the higher accumulation of
      vindoline in transgenic plants.

PG  - 123-32

AB  - Plasmids introduced in Mucor circinelloides (and most transformable Mucorales)
      tend to replicate autonomously, and hardly ever integrate in the genome. This is 
      critical if we want to express exogenous genes, because plasmids are easily lost 
      during vegetative growth, and the ratio of plasmid molecules/nuclei is invariably
      low. Linearized molecules of DNA have been used to get their genomic integration 
      but the transformation efficiency drops extremely. We have developed and highly
      optimized an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for M.
      circinelloides to facilitate the integration of transforming DNA in the genome of
      the recipient strain that could also be used for other Mucorales.

PG  - 652-4
LID - 10.1107/S1744309112013942 [doi]
AB  - Haloalkane dehalogenases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic reaction of a
      wide variety of haloalkyl substrates to form the corresponding alcohol and
      hydrogen halide products. DatA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 is a haloalkane
      dehalogenase that has a unique pair of halide-binding residues, asparagine
      (Asn43) and tyrosine (Tyr109), instead of the asparagine and tryptophan that are 
      conserved in other members of the subfamily. DatA was expressed in Escherichia
      coli, purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method
      with a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M CHES pH 8.6, 1.0 M potassium sodium
      tartrate, 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 0.01 M barium chloride. X-ray diffraction data
      were collected to 1.70 A resolution. The space group of the crystal was
      determined as the primitive tetragonal space group P422, with unit-cell
      parameters a = b = 123.7, c = 88.1 A. The crystal contained two molecules in the 
      asymmetric unit.

AB  - The plant-growth-promoting bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens CCNWGS0286,
      isolated from the nodules of Robinia pseudoacacia growing in zinc-lead mine
      tailings, both displayed high metal resistance and enhanced the growth of Robinia
      plants in a metal-contaminated environment. Our goal was to determine whether
      bacterial metal resistance or the capacity to produce phytohormones had a larger 
      impact on the growth of host plants under zinc stress. Eight zinc-sensitive
      mutants and one zinc-sensitive mutant with reduced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)
      production were obtained by transposon mutagenesis. Analysis of the genome
      sequence and of transcription via reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) combined
      with transposon gene disruptions revealed that ZntA-4200 and the transcriptional 
      regulator ZntR1 played important roles in the zinc homeostasis of A. tumefaciens 
      CCNWGS0286. In addition, interruption of a putative oligoketide cyclase/lipid
      transport protein reduced IAA synthesis and also showed reduced zinc and cadmium 
      resistance but had no influence on copper resistance. In greenhouse studies, R.
      pseudoacacia inoculated with A. tumefaciens CCNWGS0286 displayed a significant
      increase in biomass production over that without inoculation, even in a
      zinc-contaminated environment. Interestingly, the differences in plant biomass
      improvement among A. tumefaciens CCNWGS0286, A. tumefaciens C58, and
      zinc-sensitive mutants 12-2 (zntA::Tn5) and 15-6 (low IAA production) revealed
      that phytohormones, rather than genes encoding zinc resistance determinants, were
      the dominant factor in enhancing plant growth in contaminated soil.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens tumor morphology root plastid localization and
      preferential usage of hydroxylated prenyl donor is important for efficient gall
      formation.
PG  - 1064-72
LID - 10.1104/pp.112.198572 [doi]
AB  - Upon Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of a host plant, Tumor morphology root
      (Tmr) a bacterial adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT), creates a
      metabolic bypass in the plastid for direct synthesis of trans-zeatin (tZ) with
      1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate as the prenyl donor. To understand
      the biological importance of Tmr function for gall formation, we compared Tmr and
      Trans-zeatin secretion (Tzs) another agrobacterial IPT that functions within the 
      bacterial cell. Although there is no significant difference in their substrate
      specificities in vitro, ectopic overexpression of Tzs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
      thaliana) resulted in the accumulation of comparable amounts of tZ- and
      N(6)-(Delta(2)-isopentenyl)adenine (iP)-type cytokinins, whereas overexpression
      of Tmr resulted exclusively in the accumulation of tZ-type cytokinins. Ectopic
      expression of Tzs in plant cells yields only small amounts of the polypeptide in 
      plastid-enriched fractions. Obligatory localization of Tzs into Arabidopsis
      plastid stroma by translational fusions with ferredoxin transit peptide (TP-Tzs) 
      increased the accumulation of both tZ- and iP-type cytokinins. Replacement of tmr
      on the Ti plasmid with tzs, TP-tzs, or an Arabidopsis plastidic IPT induced the
      formation of smaller galls than wild-type A. tumefaciens, and they were
      accompanied by the accumulation of iP-type cytokinins. Tmr is thus specialized
      for plastid localization and preferential usage of
      1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in vivo and is important for
      efficient gall formation.

PG  - 176-82
LID - 10.1007/s00284-012-0140-5 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AtMT) has become a common
      technique for DNA transformation of yeast and filamentous fungi. In this study,
      we first established a protocol of AtMT for the phytopathogenic fungus
      Colletotrichum sansevieriae. Binary T-DNA vector containing the hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase gene controlled by the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter and 
      the trpC terminator was constructed with pCAMBIA0380 and used with three
      different strains LBA4404, GV3101, and GV2260 of A. tumefaciens. Transformants
      were most effectively obtained when GV2260 and C. sansevieriae Sa-1-2 were
      co-cultivated; there were about 320 transformants per 10(6) spores. When 1,048
      transformants were inoculated on Sansevieria trifasciata, three transformants
      were found to have completely lost their pathogenicity and two transformants
      displayed reduced pathogenicity. All of the five transformants had a single copy 
      of T-DNA in their genomes. The three pathogenicity-deficient transformants were
      subjected to thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction and the
      reaction allowed us to amplify the sequences flanking the left and/or right
      borders. The flanking sequences of the two transformants, M154 and M875, showed
      no homology to any sequences in databases, but the sequences of M678 contained
      motifs of alpha-1,3-glucan synthase, suggesting that the gene might contribute to
      the pathogenicity of C. sansevieriae. This study describes a useful method for
      investigating pathogenicity genes in C. sansevieriae.

TI  - Linear chromosome-generating system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58:
      protelomerase generates and protects hairpin ends.
PG  - 25551-63
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.369488 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, the pathogenic bacteria that causes crown gall
      disease in plants, harbors one circular and one linear chromosome and two
      circular plasmids. The telomeres of its unusual linear chromosome are covalently 
      closed hairpins. The circular and linear chromosomes co-segregate and are stably 
      maintained in the organism. We have determined the sequence of the two ends of
      the linear chromosome thus completing the previously published genome sequence of
      A. tumefaciens C58. We found that the telomeres carry nearly identical 25-bp
      sequences at the hairpin ends that are related by dyad symmetry. We further
      showed that its Atu2523 gene encodes a protelomerase (resolvase) and that the
      purified enzyme can generate the linear chromosomal closed hairpin ends in a
      sequence-specific manner. Agrobacterium protelomerase, whose presence is
      apparently limited to biovar 1 strains, acts via a cleavage-and-religation
      mechanism by making a pair of transient staggered nicks invariably at 6-bp
      spacing as the reaction intermediate. The enzyme can be significantly shortened
      at both the N and C termini and still maintain its enzymatic activity. Although
      the full-length enzyme can uniquely bind to its product telomeres, the N-terminal
      truncations cannot. The target site can also be shortened from the native 50-bp
      inverted repeat to 26 bp; thus, the Agrobacterium hairpin-generating system
      represents the most compact activity of all hairpin linear chromosome- and
      plasmid-generating systems to date. The biochemical analyses of the protelomerase
      reactions further revealed that the tip of the hairpin telomere may be unusually 
      polymorphically capable of accommodating any nucleotide.

TI  - The quorum-sensing protein TraR of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is susceptible to
      intrinsic and TraM-mediated proteolytic instability.
PG  - 807-15
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.08037.x [doi]
AB  - TraR of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a LuxR-type transcription factor that
      regulates genes required for replication and conjugation of the tumour-inducing
      plasmid. TraR binds the pheromone 3-oxo-octanoylhomoserine lactone (OOHL) and
      requires this molecule for folding into a protease-resistant, soluble
      conformation. Even after binding to OOHL, TraR is degraded at readily detectable 
      rates. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of TraR, which binds OOHL, is more
      resistant to degradation than the full length protein, suggesting that sites on
      the C-terminal DNA binding domain [TraR(170-234)] enhance protein turnover. A
      fusion between GFP and TraR(170-234) was poorly fluorescent, and truncations of
      this fusion protein allowed us to identify residues in this domain that
      contribute to protein degradation. TraR activity was previously shown to be
      inhibited by the antiactivator TraM. These proteins form 2:2 complexes that fail 
      to bind DNA sequences. Here we show that TraM sharply decreased the accumulation 
      of TraR in whole cells, indicating that TraM facilitates proteolysis of TraR. The
      TraM component of these complexes is spared from proteolysis, and could therefore
      act catalytically.

TI  - A glutathione transferase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens reveals a novel class of
      bacterial GST superfamily.
PG  - e34263
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0034263 [doi]
AB  - In the present work, we report a novel class of glutathione transferases (GSTs)
      originated from the pathogenic soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, with
      structural and catalytic properties not observed previously in prokaryotic and
      eukaryotic GST isoenzymes. A GST-like sequence from A. tumefaciens C58 (Atu3701) 
      with low similarity to other characterized GST family of enzymes was identified. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that it belongs to a distinct GST class not
      previously described and restricted only in soil bacteria, called the Eta class
      (H). This enzyme (designated as AtuGSTH1-1) was cloned and expressed in E. coli
      and its structural and catalytic properties were investigated. Functional
      analysis showed that AtuGSTH1-1 exhibits significant transferase activity against
      the common substrates aryl halides, as well as very high peroxidase activity
      towards organic hydroperoxides. The crystal structure of AtuGSTH1-1 was
      determined at 1.4 A resolution in complex with S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione
      (Nb-GSH). Although AtuGSTH1-1 adopts the canonical GST fold, sequence and
      structural characteristics distinct from previously characterized GSTs were
      identified. The absence of the classic catalytic essential residues (Tyr, Ser,
      Cys) distinguishes AtuGSTH1-1 from all other cytosolic GSTs of known structure
      and function. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that instead of the classic
      catalytic residues, an Arg residue (Arg34), an electron-sharing network, and a
      bridge of a network of water molecules may form the basis of the catalytic

AB  - Microorganisms use different pathways for D-galacturonate catabolism. In the
      known microbial oxidative pathway, D-galacturonate is oxidized to
      D-galactarolactone, the lactone hydrolyzed to galactarate, which is further
      converted to 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate and alpha-ketoglutarate. We have shown
      recently that Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 contains an uronate
      dehydrogenase (At Udh) that oxidizes D-galacturonic acid to D-galactarolactone.
      Here we report identification of a novel enzyme from the same A. tumefaciens
      strain, which we named Galactarolactone cycloisomerase (At Gci) (E.C. 5.5.1.-),
      for the direct conversion of the D-galactarolactone to 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate.
      The At Gci enzyme is 378 amino acids long and belongs to the mandelate racemase
      subgroup in the enolase superfamily. At Gci was heterologously expressed in
      Escherichia coli, and the purified enzyme was found to exist as an octameric
      form. It is active both on D-galactarolactone and D-glucarolactone, but does not 
      work on the corresponding linear hexaric acid forms. The details of the reaction 
      mechanism were further studied by NMR and optical rotation demonstrating that the
      reaction product of At Gci from D-galactaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,4-lactone
      conversion is in both cases the L-threo form of 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate.

TI  - [Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) for the screening for
      genes involved in laccase glucose repression in the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus
      neoformans].
PG  - 44-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify genes in glucose repression of laccase in the human
      pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. METHODS: We created a random insertional
      mutagenesis library containing over 200000 transformants by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT). We screened the glucose derepression 
      mutants under high-glucose condition and obtained the genes for glucose
      repression of laccase via inverse polymerase chains reaction (PCR). RESULTS:
      Totally, we isolted 30 glucose derepression mutants from the library. We found
      that that 83% of the mutants contain a single T-DNA via Southern blot. We
      preliminarily identified 10 genes, which fall into a broad range of biological
      processes including: carbohydrate metabolism, sterol biosynthesis, chitin
      biosynthesis and glycosylphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis.
      Additionally, we found that three glucose derepression mutants have a single
      T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of LAC1, which encodes cryptococcal
      laccase. CONCLUSION: As an effective way, ATMT can be utilized for identifying
      genes in glucose repression of laccase, which sheds lights on the roles of
      laccase in virulence and provides information for laccase production in industry.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens can obtain sulphur from an opine that is synthesized by
      octopine synthase using S-methylmethionine as a substrate.
PG  - 845-56
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2012.08061.x [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens incites plant tumours that produce nutrients called
      opines, which are utilized by the bacteria during host colonization. Various
      opines provide sources of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous, but virtually nothing
      was previously known about how A. tumefaciens acquires sulphur during
      colonization. Some strains encode an operon required for the catabolism of the
      opine octopine. This operon contains a gene, msh, that is predicted to direct the
      conversion of S-methylmethionine (SMM) and homocysteine (HCys) to two equivalents
      of methionine. Purified Msh carried out this reaction, suggesting that SMM could 
      be an intermediate in opine catabolism. Purified octopine synthase (Ocs, normally
      expressed in plant tumours) utilized SMM and pyruvate to produce a novel opine,
      designated sulfonopine, whose catabolism by the bacteria would regenerate SMM.
      Sulfonopine was produced by tobacco and Arabidopsis when colonized by A.
      tumefaciens and was utilized as sole source of sulphur by A. tumefaciens.
      Purified Ocs also used 13 other proteogenic and non-proteogenic amino acids as
      substrates, including three that contain sulphur. Sulfonopine and 11 other opines
      were tested for induction of octopine catabolic operon and all were able to do
      so. This is the first study of the acquisition of sulphur, an essential element, 
      by this pathogen.

TI  - Identification of nicotine biotransformation intermediates by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens strain S33 suggests a novel nicotine degradation pathway.
PG  - 1567-78
LID - 10.1007/s00253-012-4007-2 [doi]
AB  - Nicotine, a major alkaloid in tobacco plants and the main toxic chemical in
      tobacco wastes, can be transformed by bacteria into hydroxylated-pyridine
      intermediates, which are important precursors for the chemical synthesis of
      valuable drugs and insecticides. Such biotransformation could be a useful
      approach to utilize tobacco and its wastes. In this study, we explored nicotine
      degradation by a recently isolated Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33 by identifying
      the intermediates during its growth on nicotine and during transformation of
      nicotine with its resting cells. Five hydroxylated-pyridine intermediates were
      detected through multiple approaches, including GC-HR-MS, HPLC, and ESI-Q-TOF MS 
      analyses. Surprisingly, these identified intermediates suggest that strain S33
      employs a novel pathway that is different from the two characterized pathways
      described in Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas. Based on these findings, we propose
      that strain S33 is able to transform nicotine to 6-hydroxy-pseudooxynicotine
      first via the pyridine pathway through 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine and
      6-hydroxy-N-methylmyosmine, and then, it turns to the pyrrolidine pathway with
      the formation of 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. The
      activities of the key enzymes, nicotine dehydrogenase, 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine
      oxidase, and 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine hydroxylase, were demonstrated in the 
      cell extract of strain S33 and by partially enriched enzymes. Moreover, the cell 
      extract could transform 6-hydroxy-pseudooxynicotine into
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine by coupling with 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine oxidation
      reaction by 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine oxidase. These results indicated that strain S33
      can transform nicotine into renewable hydroxylated-pyridine intermediates by the 
      special pathway, in which at least three intermediates, 6-hydroxy-L-nicotine,
      6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine, and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, have potential to be
      further chemically modified into useful compounds.

AB  - Small high-yielding binary Ti vectors of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were
      constructed to increase the cloning efficiency and plasmid yield in Escherichia
      coli and A. tumefaciens for transformation of higher plants. We reduced the size 
      of the binary vector backbone to 4566bp with ColE1 replicon (715bp) for E. coli
      and VS1 replicon (2654bp) for A. tumefaciens, a bacterial kanamycin resistance
      gene (999bp), and the T-DNA region (152bp). The binary Ti vectors with the
      truncated VS1 replicon were stably maintained with more than 98% efficiency in A.
      tumefaciens without antibiotic selection for 4 days of successive transfers. The 
      transcriptional direction of VS1 replicon can be the same as that of ColE1
      replicon (co-directional transcription), or opposite (head-on transcription) as
      in the case of widely used vectors (pPZP or pCambia). New binary vectors with
      co-directional transcription yielded in E. coli up to four-fold higher
      transformation frequency than those with the head-on transcription. In A.
      tumefaciens the effect of co-directional transcription is still positive in up to
      1.8-fold higher transformation frequency than that of head-on transcription.
      Transformation frequencies of new vectors are over six-fold higher than those of 
      pCambia vector in A. tumefaciens. DNA yields of new vectors were three to
      five-fold greater than pCambia in E. coli. The proper functions of the new T-DNA 
      borders and new plant selection marker genes were confirmed after A.
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation of tobacco leaf discs, resulting in virtually
      all treated leaf discs transformed and induced calli. Genetic analysis of
      kanamycin resistance trait among the progeny showed that the kanamycin resistance
      and sensitivity traits were segregated into the 3:1 ratio, indicating that the
      kanamycin resistance genes were integrated stably into a locus or closely linked 
      loci of the nuclear chromosomal DNA of the primary transgenic tobacco plants and 
      inherited to the second generation.

TI  - Transformation of LRP gene into Brassica napus mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens to enhance lysine content in seeds.
PG  - 1616-21
AB  - Lysine rich protein (LRP) gene derived from the seed of Psophocarpus
      tetragonolobus was transformed into Brassica napus, employing cotyledon petiole
      as explants and by using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404.
      Transformation efficiency was found to be closely related with phytohormone
      concentration, infection incubation, and co-cultured time. A medium containing 4 
      mg/l 6-benzyladenine (6-BA) and 0.3 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) was used
      for plant regeneration. With infection incubation of A. tumefaciens (OD600 = 0.4)
      for 20 min and co-culture of infected cotyledon petiole for 3 days, the highest
      transformation efficiency of 8.5% was obtained. To confirm LRP gene expression,
      PCR and Southern blot analysis were performed on leaf-isolated DNA from
      regenerated plants resistant to kanamycin. All transgenic plants of the
      generation T0 formed fertile seeds, which were sowed for the inheritance study of
      generational T1 and amino acid analysis. It was found that the lysine content of 
      seeds from T1 generation increased by 16.7% compared with non-transgenic lines.

AB  - The establishment of high-efficiency Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
      techniques could improve the production of Dioscorea zingiberensis, a medicinal
      species with a high diosgenin content. We co-cultivated embryogenic calli induced
      from mature seeds with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105. A binary vector,
      pCAMBIA1381, which contains the gfp and hpt genes under the control of the
      ubiquitin promoter and the CaMV 35S promoter, respectively, was used for
      transformation. Pre-culture, basic medium, acetosyringone, and bacterial density 
      were evaluated to establish the most efficient protocol. The optimal conditions
      consisted of MS medium without CaCl(2) for pre- and co-cultivation, three days
      for pre-culture, addition of 200 muM AS, and an OD(600) of 0.5. The transgenic
      plants grown under selection were confirmed by PCR analysis and Southern blot
      analysis. This protocol produced transgenic D. zingiberensis plants in seven
      months, with a transformation efficiency of 6%.

TI  - Cationic Surfactants: Potential Surface Disinfectants to Manage Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens Biovar 1 Contamination of Grafting Tools.
PG  - 409-415
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-11-10-0839 [doi]
AB  - Nursery production of walnut seedlings is a 2-year process, during which crown
      gall, caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, often develops at grafting wounds. In 
      this study, the spread of crown gall via contaminated tools and the efficacy of
      several disinfectants against A. tumefaciens were demonstrated. The cationic
      surfactants benzalkonium chloride (BC), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),
      and Physan 20 eliminated 100% of the A. tumefaciens population in water
      suspensions treated at 7, 5, and 2 ppm, respectively. Sodium hypochlorite
      eliminated 100% of the A. tumefaciens population at 0.5 ppm. Sodium hypochlorite 
      efficacy, however, was reduced by 64% in the presence of total solids (0.7 g/ml) 
      which are commonly found in field situations. At similar concentrations of total 
      solids, the efficacy of cationic surfactants decreased, on average, by only 13%. 
      The minimum effective treatment needed to eliminate A. tumefaciens on infested
      scalpels was a 5-s exposure to BC or CTAB at 5,000 ppm (0.5%). Infested scalpels 
      treated with BC or CTAB at less than 5,000 ppm caused gall formation in 14 +/- 7%
      of cuts made on Datura stramonium stems. This was significantly less than the
      tumor incidence (100%) in cuts made with inoculated blades not treated BC or
      CTAB.

AB  - Transgenic oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantlets are regenerated after
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of embryogenic calli derived
      from young leaves of oil palm. The calli are transformed with an Agrobacterium
      strain, LBA4404, harboring the plasmid pUBA, which carries a selectable marker
      gene (bar) for resistance to the herbicide Basta and is driven by a maize
      ubiquitin promoter. Modifications of the transformation method, treatment of the 
      target tissues using acetosyringone, exposure to a plasmolysis medium, and
      physical injury via biolistics are applied. The main reasons for such
      modifications are to activate the bacterial virulence system and, subsequently,
      to increase the transformation efficiency. Transgenic oil palm cells are selected
      and regenerated on a medium containing herbicide Basta. Molecular analyses
      revealed the presence and integration of the introduced bar gene into the genome 
      of the transformants.

      transgenes are stably expressed and show Mendelian inheritance in subsequent
      generations.

PG  - 446-57
LID - 10.4161/rna.17212 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium species are capable of interkingdom gene transfer between bacteria 
      and plants. The genome of Agrobacterium tumefaciens consists of a circular and a 
      linear chromosome, the At-plasmid and the Ti-plasmid, which harbors bacterial
      virulence genes required for tumor formation in plants. Little is known about
      promoter sequences and the small RNA (sRNA) repertoire of this and other
      alpha-proteobacteria. We used a differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) approach
      to map transcriptional start sites of 388 annotated genes and operons. In
      addition, a total number of 228 sRNAs was revealed from all four Agrobacterium
      replicons. Twenty-two of these were confirmed by independent RNA gel blot
      analysis and several sRNAs were differentially expressed in response to growth
      media, growth phase, temperature or pH. One sRNA from the Ti-plasmid was
      massively induced under virulence conditions. The presence of 76 cis-antisense
      sRNAs, two of them on the reverse strand of virulence genes, suggests
      considerable antisense transcription in Agrobacterium. The information gained
      from this study provides a valuable reservoir for an in-depth understanding of
      sRNA-mediated regulation of the complex physiology and infection process of
      Agrobacterium.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin plays a role in protection
      against hydrogen peroxide toxicity and is negatively regulated by the iron
      response regulator.
PG  - 87-92
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2012.02509.x [doi]
AB  - An Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin (mbfA) mutant was generated 
      to assess the physiological functions of mbfA in response to iron and hydrogen
      peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) stresses. Wild-type and the mbfA mutant strains showed
      similar growth under high- and low-iron conditions. The mbfA mutant was more
      sensitive to H(2) O(2) than wild-type strain. Expression of a functional mbfA
      gene could complement the H(2) O(2) -hypersensitive phenotype of the mbfA mutant 
      and a rhizobial iron regulator (rirA) mutant, suggesting that MbfA protects cells
      from H(2) O(2) toxicity by sequestering intracellular free iron, thus preventing 
      the Fenton reaction. The expression of mbfA could be induced in response to iron 
      and to H(2) O(2) treatment. The iron response regulator (irr) also acted as a
      repressor of mbfA expression. An irr mutant had high constitutive expression of
      mbfA, which partly contributed to the H(2) O(2) -hyperresistant phenotype of the 
      irr mutant. The data reported here demonstrate an important role of A.
      tumefaciens MbfA in the cellular defence against iron and H(2) O(2) stresses.

TI  - High reliability transformation of the wheat pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana using
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 386-92
LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2012.01.004 [doi]
AB  - Bipolaris sorokiniana, the causal agent of spot blotch of wheat, significantly
      reduces grain yield worldwide. In order to study pathogenic mechanisms of the
      fungus, conditions for efficient transformation using Agrobacterium-mediated
      transformation were investigated. To study different stages of hyphal fusion and 
      pathogenic mechanisms of the fungus, two fluorescence markers viz. the red
      fluorescent protein (DsRed-Express) and the green fluorescent protein (EGFP1)
      were constitutively expressed. Southern hybridizations confirmed the presence of 
      T-DNA in all hygromycin B or geneticin resistant transformants, and also showed
      random and single copy integration. Fluorescence microscopy suggested the high
      level expression of both DsRed and EGFP fluorescent proteins in spores and
      mycelia. The results signify that DsRed and EGFP can be used as efficient
      reporter gene for monitoring B. sorokiniana hyphal fusion as well as colonization
      in the host tissues. This work will be useful to develop methodologies for
      understanding the mechanisms of Bipolaris-wheat interaction and functional
      genomics of B. sorokiniana for various applications including insertional
      mutagenesis, targeted disruption of specific genes, ectopic complementation of
      loss-of-function strains and over-expression.

AB  - We describe the genetic transformation of the mycelial tissue of Diaporthe
      phaseolorum, an endophytic fungus isolated from the mangrove species Laguncularia
      racemosa, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT). ATMT
      uses both the hygromycin B resistant (hph) gene and green fluorescent protein as 
      the selection agents. The T-DNA integration into the fungal genome was assessed
      by both PCR and Southern blotting. All transformants examined were mitotically
      stable. An analysis of the T-DNA flanking sequences by thermal asymmetric
      interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) demonstrated that the disrupted genes in the
      transformants had similarities with conserved domains in proteins involved in
      antibiotic biosynthesis pathways. A library of 520 transformants was generated,
      and 31 of these transformants had no antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus
      aureus, an important human pathogen. The protocol described here, using ATMT in
      D. phaseolorum, will be useful for the identification and analysis of fungal
      genes controlling pathogenicity and antibiotic pathways. Moreover, this protocol 
      may be used as a reference for other species in the Diaporthe genus. This is the 
      first report to describe Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of D. phaseolorum 
      as a tool for insertional mutagenesis.

TI  - [T-DNA integration patterns in transgenic plants mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens].
PG  - 1327-34
AB  - The genetic transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been widely 
      applied to research of transgenic plants. As the vector of the exotic genes, the 
      integration patterns of T-DNA fragments affects not only transformation
      efficiency and stability, but also expression properties of the transgenes. This 
      review summaries the two major patterns and the rules of T-DNA integration in
      Agrobacterim-mediated transformation, rules of T-DNA mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, as well as research tools for flanking sequence amplification. It is
      attempted to provide references for researches on transformation and T-DNA
      integration mutation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

AB  - Genome sequence data on fungal pathogens provide the opportunity to carry out a
      reverse genetics approach to uncover gene function. Efficient methods for
      targeted genome modifications such as knockout and in locus over-expression are
      in high demand. Here we describe two efficient single-step cloning strategies for
      construction of vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
      (ATMT). Targeted genome modifications require integration by a homologous double 
      crossover event, which is achieved by placing target sequences on either side of 
      a selection marker gene in the vector. Protocols are given for two single-step
      vector construction techniques. The In-Fusion cloning technique is independent of
      compatible restriction enzyme sites in the vector and the fragment to be cloned. 
      The method can be directly applied to any vector of choice and it is possible to 
      carry out four fragment cloning without the need for subcloning. The cloning
      efficiency is not always as high as desired, but it still presents an efficient
      alternative to restriction enzyme and ligase-based cloning systems. The USER
      technology offers a higher four fragment cloning efficiency than In-Fusion, but
      depends on specific structures in the binary vector. The available fungal binary 
      vectors adapted for the USER system are described and protocols are provided for 
      vector design and construction. A general protocol for verification of the
      resulting gene replacement events in the recipient fungal cells is also given.
      The cloning systems described above are relevant for all transformation vector
      constructs, but here we describe their application for ATMT compatible binary
      vectors. Protocols are provided for ATMT exemplified by Fusarium graminearum. For
      large-scale reverse genetic projects, the USER technology is recommended combined
      with ATMT.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Aspergillus aculeatus for
      insertional mutagenesis.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/2191-0855-1-46 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) was applied to
      Aspergillus aculeatus. Transformants carrying the T-DNA from a binary vector
      pBIG2RHPH2 were sufficiently mitotically stable to allow functional genomic
      analyses. The AMT technique was optimized by altering the concentration of
      acetosyringone, the ratio and concentration of A. tumefaciens and A. aculeatus
      cells, the duration of co-cultivation, and the status of A. aculeatus cells when 
      using conidia, protoplasts, or germlings. On average, 30 transformants per 104
      conidia or 217 transformants per 107 conidia were obtained under the optimized
      conditions when A. tumefaciens co-cultured with fungi using solid or liquid
      induction media (IM). Although the transformation frequency in liquid IM was
      100-fold lower than that on solid IM, the AMT method using liquid IM is better
      suited for high-throughput insertional mutagenesis because the transformants can 
      be isolated on fewer selection media plates by concentrating the transformed
      germlings. The production of two albino A. aculeatus mutants by AMT confirmed
      that the inserted T-DNA disrupted the polyketide synthase gene AapksP, which is
      involved in pigment production. Considering the efficiency of AMT and the
      correlation between the phenotypes and genotypes of the transformants, the
      established AMT technique offers a highly efficient means for characterizing the 
      gene function in A. aculeatus.

LID - 10.1186/1746-4811-7-42 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cloning genes into plasmid vectors is one of the key steps for
      studying gene function. Recently, Invitrogen developed a convenient Gateway(R)
      cloning system based on the site-specific DNA recombination properties of
      bacteriophage lambda and the cytotoxic protein ccdB, which is lethal to most E.
      coli strains. The ccdB protein, however, is not toxic to Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, an important player often used for studying gene function in planta.
      This limits the direct application of the Gateway(R) cloning system in plant
      transformation-mediated research. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed a novel 
      Gateway(R)-compatible destination vector, pEG101-SacB/R, by replacing the ccdB
      gene with a SacB-SacR gene cassette as the negative selectable marker.
      CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the new pEG101-SacB/R destination vector
      can be used for Gateway(R) cloning in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. pEG101-SacB/R
      will be a valuable tool for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in

AB  - Virulence protein VirE2 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens is involved in plant
      infection by transferring a fragment of agrobacterial Ti plasmid ssT-DNA in
      complex with VirE2-VirD2 proteins into the plant cell nucleus. The VirE2 protein 
      interactions with ssDNA and formation of VirE2 protein complexes in vitro and in 
      silico have been studied. Using dynamic light scattering we found that purified
      recombinant protein VirE2 exists in buffer solution in the form of complexes of
      2-4 protein molecules of 12-18 nm size. We used computer methods to design models
      of complexes consisting of two and four individual VirE2 proteins, and their
      dimensions were estimated. Dimensions of VirE2 complexes with ssDNA (550 and 700 
      nucleotide residues) were determined using transmission electron microscopy and
      dynamic light scattering. We found that in vitro, upon interaction with ssDNA
      recombinant protein, VirE2 is able to alter conformation of the latter by
      shortening the initial length of the ssDNA.

PG  - 391-403
LID - 10.1007/s00203-011-0767-9 [doi]
AB  - Environmental biofilms often contain mixed populations of different species. In
      these dense communities, competition between biofilm residents for limited
      nutrients such as iron can be fierce, leading to the evolution of competitive
      factors that affect the ability of competitors to grow or form biofilms. We have 
      discovered a compound(s) present in the conditioned culture fluids of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa that disperses and inhibits the formation of biofilms produced by the 
      facultative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The inhibitory activity is 
      strongly induced when P. aeruginosa is cultivated in iron-limited conditions, but
      it does not function through iron sequestration. In addition, the production of
      the biofilm inhibitory activity is not regulated by the global iron regulatory
      protein Fur, the iron-responsive extracytoplasmic function sigma factor PvdS, or 
      three of the recognized P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing systems. In addition, the
      compound(s) responsible for the inhibition and dispersal of A. tumefaciens
      biofilm formation is likely distinct from the recently identified P. aeruginosa
      dispersal factor, cis-2-decenoic acid (CDA), as dialysis of the culture fluids
      showed that the inhibitory compound was larger than CDA and culture fluids that
      dispersed and inhibited biofilm formation by A. tumefaciens had no effect on
      biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Reasons for lower transformation efficiency in indica rice using Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation: lessons from transformation assays and
      genome-wide expression profiling.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s11103-011-9842-5 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation has been routinely used
      in rice for more than a decade. However, the transformation efficiency of the
      indica rice variety is still unsatisfactory and much lower than that of japonica 
      cultivars. Further improvement on the transformation efficiency lies in the
      genetic manipulation of the plant itself, which requires a better understanding
      of the underlying process accounting for the susceptibility of plant cells to
      Agrobacterium infection as well as the identification of plant genes involved in 
      the transformation process. In this study, transient and stable transformation
      assays using different japonica and indica cultivars showed that the lower
      transformation efficiency in indica rice was mainly due to the low efficiency in 
      T-DNA integration into the plant genome. Analyses of the global gene expression
      patterns across the transformation process in different varieties revealed major 
      differences in the expression of genes responding to Agrobacterium within the
      first 6 h after infection and more differentially expressed genes were observed
      in the indica cultivar Zhenshan 97 (ZS), with a number of genes repressed early
      during infection. Microarray analysis revealed an important effect of plant
      defense response on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. It has been shown that
      some genes which may be necessary for the transformation process were
      down-regulated in the indica cultivar ZS. This dataset provided a versatile
      resource for plant genomic research to understand the regulatory network of
      transformation process, and showed great promise for improving indica rice
      transformation using genetic manipulation of the rice genome.

TI  - A photolyase-like protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens with an iron-sulfur
      cluster.
PG  - e26775
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0026775 [doi]
AB  - Photolyases and cryptochromes are evolutionarily related flavoproteins with
      distinct functions. While photolyases can repair UV-induced DNA lesions in a
      light-dependent manner, cryptochromes regulate growth, development and the
      circadian clock in plants and animals. Here we report about two
      photolyase-related proteins, named PhrA and PhrB, found in the phytopathogen
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens. PhrA belongs to the class III cyclobutane pyrimidine
      dimer (CPD) photolyases, the sister class of plant cryptochromes, while PhrB
      belongs to a new class represented in at least 350 bacterial organisms. Both
      proteins contain flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a primary catalytic
      cofactor, which is photoreduceable by blue light. Spectral analysis of PhrA
      confirmed the presence of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) as antenna
      cofactor. PhrB comprises also an additional chromophore, absorbing in the short
      wavelength region but its spectrum is distinct from known antenna cofactors in
      other photolyases. Homology modeling suggests that PhrB contains an Fe-S cluster 
      as cofactor which was confirmed by elemental analysis and EPR spectroscopy.
      According to protein sequence alignments the classical tryptophan photoreduction 
      pathway is present in PhrA but absent in PhrB. Although PhrB is clearly
      distinguished from other photolyases including PhrA it is, like PhrA, required
      for in vivo photoreactivation. Moreover, PhrA can repair UV-induced DNA lesions
      in vitro. Thus, A. tumefaciens contains two photolyase homologs of which PhrB
      represents the first member of the cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF) that
      contains an iron-sulfur cluster.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) transfer DNA and/or proteins into
      recipient cells. Here we performed immunofluorescence deconvolution microscopy to
      localize the assembled T4SS by detection of its native components VirB1, VirB2,
      VirB4, VirB5, VirB7, VirB8, VirB9, VirB10, and VirB11 in the C58 nopaline strain 
      of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, following induction of virulence (vir) gene
      expression. These different proteins represent T4SS components spanning the inner
      membrane, periplasm, or outer membrane. Native VirB2, VirB5, VirB7, and VirB8
      were also localized in the A. tumefaciens octopine strain A348. Quantitative
      analyses of the localization of all the above Vir proteins in nopaline and
      octopine strains revealed multiple foci in single optical sections in over 80%
      and 70% of the bacterial cells, respectively. Green fluorescent protein
      (GFP)-VirB8 expression following vir induction was used to monitor bacterial
      binding to live host plant cells; bacteria bind predominantly along their
      lengths, with few bacteria binding via their poles or subpoles. vir-induced
      attachment-defective bacteria or bacteria without the Ti plasmid do not bind to
      plant cells. These data support a model where multiple vir-T4SS around the
      perimeter of the bacterium maximize effective contact with the host to facilitate
      efficient transfer of DNA and protein substrates. IMPORTANCE: Transfer of DNA
      and/or proteins to host cells through multiprotein type IV secretion system
      (T4SS) complexes that span the bacterial cell envelope is critical to bacterial
      pathogenesis. Early reports suggested that T4SS components localized at the cell 
      poles. Now, higher-resolution deconvolution fluorescence microscopy reveals that 
      all structural components of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens vir-T4SS, as well as
      its transported protein substrates, localize to multiple foci around the cell
      perimeter. These results lead to a new model of A. tumefaciens attachment to a
      plant cell, where A. tumefaciens takes advantage of the multiple vir-T4SS along
      its length to make intimate lateral contact with plant cells and thereby
      effectively transfer DNA and/or proteins through the vir-T4SS. The T4SS of A.
      tumefaciens is among the best-studied T4SS, and the majority of its components
      are highly conserved in different pathogenic bacterial species. Thus, the results
      presented can be applied to a broad range of pathogens that utilize T4SS.

AB  - The chvE-gguABC operon plays a critical role in both virulence and sugar
      utilization through the activities of the periplasmic ChvE protein, which binds
      to a variety of sugars. The roles of the GguA, GguB, and GguC are not known.
      While GguA and GguB are homologous to bacterial ABC transporters, earlier genetic
      analysis indicated that they were not necessary for utilization of sugars as the 
      sole carbon source. To further examine this issue, in-frame deletions were
      constructed separately for each of the three genes. Our growth analysis clearly
      indicated that GguA and GguB play a role in sugar utilization and strongly
      suggests that GguAB constitute an ABC transporter with a wide range of
      substrates, including L-arabinose, D-fucose, D-galactose, D-glucose, and
      D-xylose. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that a Walker A motif was vital to the
      function of GguA. We therefore propose renaming gguAB as mmsAB, for multiple
      monosaccharide transport. A gguC deletion affected growth only on L-arabinose
      medium, suggesting that gguC encodes an enzyme specific to L-arabinose
      metabolism, and this gene was renamed araD1. Results from bioinformatics and
      experimental analyses indicate that Agrobacterium tumefaciens uses a pathway
      involving nonphosphorylated intermediates to catabolize L-arabinose via an
      L-arabinose dehydrogenase, AraA(At), encoded at the Atu1113 locus.

TI  - A guide to binary vectors and strategies for targeted genome modification in
      fungi using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 247-62

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) of fungi has become a
      common technique for the study of a wide variety of different fungal species over
      the past 12 years. The discovery that the host range of A. tumefaciens could be
      extended to include fungi provided an efficient transformation tool for species
      in which it was previously impossible to conduct molecular genetics experiments. 
      ATMT experiments can be divided into three groups: i) Forward genetics (i.e.,
      random mutagenesis), ii) Reverse genetics (i.e., targeted genome modification and
      random integration) and iii) the introduction of reporter genes (e.g., GFP, RFP
      and GUS) that allow in situ monitoring of the fungus. The use of ATMT for forward
      genetics experiments has primarily included classic random insertional
      inactivation strategies to obtain loss-of-function mutants. For reverse genetics 
      experiments, ATMT has been used to introduce targeted genome modifications (e.g.,
      disruptions, replacements, overexpression and complementation) and to generate
      random integrations for complementation, heterologous expression, expression of
      transcriptional and translational fusion reporters and RNAi-mediated
      down-regulation of gene expression. This review summarizes the technical advances
      within the field from 1998 to the summer of 2011, focusing on the development of 
      binary vectors that are compatible with fungal transformation (over 180 general
      vectors) and methods for constructing binary vectors for targeted integration of 
      T-DNA into fungal genomes.

TI  - Overlapping protective roles for glutathione transferase gene family members in
      chemical and oxidative stress response in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 157-72
LID - 10.1007/s10142-011-0248-x [doi]
AB  - In the present work, we describe the characterisation of the glutathione
      transferase (GST) gene family from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. A genome survey
      revealed the presence of eight GST-like proteins in A. tumefaciens (AtuGSTs).
      Comparison by multiple sequence alignment generated a dendrogram revealing the
      phylogenetic relationships of AtuGSTs-like proteins. The beta and theta classes
      identified in other bacterial species are represented by five members in A.
      tumefaciens C58. In addition, there are three "orphan" sequences that do not fit 
      into any previously recognised GST classes. The eight GST-like genes were cloned,
      expressed in Escherichia coli and their substrate specificity was determined
      towards 17 different substrates. The results showed that AtuGSTs catalyse a broad
      range of reactions, with different members of the family exhibiting quite varied 
      substrate specificity. The 3D structures of AtuGSTs were predicted using
      molecular modelling. The use of comparative sequence and structural analysis of
      the AtuGST isoenzymes allowed us to identify local sequence and structural
      characteristics between different GST isoenzymes and classes. Gene expression
      profiling was conducted under normal culture conditions as well as under abiotic 
      stress conditions (addition of xenobiotics, osmotic stress and cold and heat
      shock) to induce and monitor early stress-response mechanisms. The results reveal
      the constitutive expression of GSTs in A. tumefaciens and a modulation of GST
      activity after treatments, indicating that AtuGSTs presumably participate in a
      wide range of functions, many of which are important in counteracting stress
      conditions. These functions may be relevant to maintaining cellular homeostasis
      as well as in the direct detoxification of toxic compounds.

TI  - Proteomic changes in grape embryogenic callus in response to Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 485-95
LID - 10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.07.016 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation is highly required for studies 
      of grapevine gene function and of huge potential for tailored variety
      improvements. However, grape is recalcitrant to transformation, and the
      underlying mechanism is largely unknown. To better understand the overall
      response of grapevine to A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, the proteomic
      profile of cv. Prime embryogenic callus (EC) after co-cultivation with A.
      tumefaciens was investigated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS 
      analysis. Over 1100 protein spots were detected in both inoculated and control
      EC, 69 of which showed significantly differential expression; 38 of these were
      successfully identified. The proteins significantly up-regulated 3 d after
      inoculation were PR10, resistance protein Pto, secretory peroxidase,
      cinnamoyl-CoA reductase and different expression regulators; down-regulated
      proteins were ascorbate peroxidase, tocopherol cyclase, Hsp 70 and proteins
      involved in the ubiquitin-associated protein-degradation pathway. A. tumefaciens 
      transformation-induced oxidative burst and modified protein-degradation pathways 
      were further validated with biochemical measurements. Our results reveal that
      agrobacterial transformation markedly inhibits the cellular ROS-removal system,
      mitochondrial energy metabolism and the protein-degradation machinery for
      misfolded proteins, while the apoptosis signaling pathway and hypersensitive
      response are strengthened, which might partially explain the low efficiency and
      severe EC necrosis in grape transformation.

AB  - The S213C, I33L, and I33L S213C variants of D-psicose 3-epimerase from
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which were obtained by random and site-directed
      mutagenesis, displayed increases of 2.5, 5, and 7.5 degrees C in the temperature 
      for maximal enzyme activity, increases of 3.3-, 7.2-, and 29.9-fold in the
      half-life at 50 degrees C, and increases of 3.1, 4.3, and 7.6 degrees C in
      apparent melting temperature, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme.
      Molecular modeling suggests that the improvement in thermostability in these
      variants may have resulted from increased putative hydrogen bonds and formation
      of new aromatic stacking interactions. The immobilized wild-type enzyme with and 
      without borate maintained activity for 8 days at a conversion yield of 70% (350
      g/liter psicose) and for 16 days at a conversion yield of 30% (150 g/liter
      psicose), respectively. After 8 or 16 days, the enzyme activity gradually
      decreased, and the conversion yields with and without borate were reduced to 22
      and 9.6%, respectively, at 30 days. In contrast, the activities of the
      immobilized I33L S213C variant with and without borate did not decrease during
      the operation time of 30 days. These results suggest that the I33L S213C variant 
      may be useful as an industrial producer of D-psicose.

AB  - The transformation of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) through Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens is still far from being routine, particularly when it comes to
      commercial varieties. In the present paper, we present an efficient and simple
      protocol for leaf disc transformation of three Vietnamese tomato cultivars (DM8, 
      MTS, FM372C) by comparing shoot regeneration media for expanding leaves and
      examining different parameters of inoculation, co-culture and selection
      conditions. The present transformation method requires neither feeder layers of
      cell suspension cultures nor pre-culture. The data clearly show that appropriate 
      cytokinin- and auxin combinations and concentrations provide competent tissues
      for transformation. Supplementing of 8 microM trans-zeatin and 5 microM
      indoleacetic acid (IAA) into pre-treatment, inoculation and co-culture media
      resulted in higher frequency of transformation and stronger GUS-expression than
      that of media supplemented with 4 microM trans-zeatin and 2 microM IAA. The
      experiments also exhibited that tomato leaf tissues were more sensitive to
      glufosinate after inoculation with Agrobacteria compared to the untreated
      controls, so a more sophisticated scheme for the glufosinate selection had to be 
      established.

TI  - Choline uptake in Agrobacterium tumefaciens by the high-affinity ChoXWV
      transporter.
PG  - 5119-29
LID - 10.1128/JB.05421-11 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a facultative phytopathogen that causes crown gall
      disease. For successful plant transformation A. tumefaciens requires the membrane
      lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is produced via the methylation and the PC 
      synthase (Pcs) pathways. The latter route is dependent on choline. Although
      choline uptake has been demonstrated in A. tumefaciens, the responsible
      transporter(s) remained elusive. In this study, we identified the first choline
      transport system in A. tumefaciens. The ABC-type choline transporter is encoded
      by the chromosomally located choXWV operon (ChoX, binding protein; ChoW,
      permease; and ChoV, ATPase). The Cho system is not critical for growth and PC
      synthesis. However, [14C]choline uptake is severely reduced in A. tumefaciens
      choX mutants. Recombinant ChoX is able to bind choline with high affinity
      (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD] of approximately 2 muM). Since other
      quaternary amines are bound by ChoX with much lower affinities (acetylcholine, KD
      of approximately 80 muM; betaine, KD of approximately 470 muM), the ChoXWV system
      functions as a high-affinity transporter with a preference for choline. Two
      tryptophan residues (W40 and W87) located in the predicted ligand-binding pocket 
      are essential for choline binding. The structural model of ChoX built on
      Sinorhizobium meliloti ChoX resembles the typical structure of substrate binding 
      proteins with a so-called "Venus flytrap mechanism" of substrate binding.

TI  - Genomic species are ecological species as revealed by comparative genomics in
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 762-81
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evr070 [doi]
AB  - The definition of bacterial species is based on genomic similarities, giving rise
      to the operational concept of genomic species, but the reasons of the occurrence 
      of differentiated genomic species remain largely unknown. We used the
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens species complex and particularly the genomic species
      presently called genomovar G8, which includes the sequenced strain C58, to test
      the hypothesis of genomic species having specific ecological adaptations possibly
      involved in the speciation process. We analyzed the gene repertoire specific to
      G8 to identify potential adaptive genes. By hybridizing 25 strains of A.
      tumefaciens on DNA microarrays spanning the C58 genome, we highlighted the
      presence and absence of genes homologous to C58 in the taxon. We found 196 genes 
      specific to genomovar G8 that were mostly clustered into seven genomic islands on
      the C58 genome-one on the circular chromosome and six on the linear
      chromosome-suggesting higher plasticity and a major adaptive role of the latter. 
      Clusters encoded putative functional units, four of which had been verified
      experimentally. The combination of G8-specific functions defines a hypothetical
      species primary niche for G8 related to commensal interaction with a host plant. 
      This supports that the G8 ancestor was able to exploit a new ecological niche,
      maybe initiating ecological isolation and thus speciation. Searching genomic data
      for synapomorphic traits is a powerful way to describe bacterial species. This
      procedure allowed us to find such phenotypic traits specific to genomovar G8 and 
      thus propose a Latin binomial, Agrobacterium fabrum, for this bona fide genomic
      species.

AB  - Plants defend themselves against potential pathogens via the recognition of
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, the molecular mechanisms
      underlying this PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) are largely unknown. In this study,
      we show that tomato HP1/DDB1, coding for a key component of the CUL4-based
      ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, is required for resistance to Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens. We found that the DDB1-deficient mutant (high pigment-1, hp1) is
      susceptible to nontumorigenic A. tumefaciens. The efficiency of callus generation
      from the hp1 cotyledons was extremely low as a result of the necrosis caused by
      Agrobacterium infection. On infiltration of nontumorigenic A. tumefaciens into
      leaves, the hp1 mutant moderately supported Agrobacterium growth and developed
      disease symptoms, but the expression of the pathogenesis-related gene SlPR1a1 and
      several PTI marker genes was compromised at different levels. Moreover, exogenous
      application of salicylic acid (SA) triggered SlPR1a1 gene expression and enhanced
      resistance to A. tumefaciens in wild-type tomato plants, whereas these
      SA-regulated defence responses were abolished in hp1 mutant plants. Thus,
      HP1/DDB1 may function through interaction with the SA-regulated PTI pathway in
      resistance against Agrobacterium infection.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens is an important plant pathogen which belongs to the
      alpha-proteobacteria. In addition, it has served as the main tool for plant
      molecular genetics. Here we focus on three major aspects: (i) proteomic mapping, 
      (ii) the use of proteomics for the understanding of the response of A.
      tumefaciens to changes in environmental conditions and (iii) the analysis of the 
      changes in genome expression following interaction with the host. These studies
      convey a global outlook on the functional genomics of A. tumefaciens and help to 
      understand the physiology of this important organism.

PG  - 27294-300
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M111.254854 [doi]
AB  - Uronate dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtUdh) belongs to the
      short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and catalyzes the oxidation of
      D-galacturonic acid and D-glucuronic acid with NAD(+) as a cofactor. We have
      determined the crystal structures of an apo-form of AtUdh, a ternary form in
      complex with NADH and product (substrate-soaked structure), and an inactive Y136A
      mutant in complex with NAD(+). The crystal structures suggest AtUdh to be a
      homohexamer, which has also been observed to be the major form in solution. The
      monomer contains a Rossmann fold, essential for nucleotide binding and a common
      feature of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes. The ternary
      complex structure reveals a product, D-galactaro-1,5-lactone, which is bound
      above the nicotinamide ring. This product rearranges in solution to
      D-galactaro-1,4-lactone as verified by mass spectrometry analysis, which agrees
      with our previous NMR study. The crystal structure of the mutant with the
      catalytic residue Tyr-136 substituted with alanine shows changes in the position 
      of Ile-74 and Ser-75. This probably altered the binding of the nicotinamide end
      of NAD(+), which was not visible in the electron density map. The structures
      presented provide novel insights into cofactor and substrate binding and the
      reaction mechanism of AtUdh. This information can be applied to the design of
      efficient microbial conversion of D-galacturonic acid-based waste materials.

      selectable marker which confers resistance to G418, the Schizochytrium
      transformants were successfully obtained on the G418-containing plates. The
      integration and expression of the transgenes were confirmed by PCR analysis and
      GUS activity assay. To further validate the transformation system,
      pCAMBIA2301-EGFP containing the egfp gene was introduced into Schizochytrium. The
      following results demonstrated that the exogenous egfp gene has been successfully
      incorporated into the genome of Schizochytrium. In addition, the introduced egfp 
      gene expressed efficiently according to the Western blot and fluorescence assay
      results. More importantly, the majority of the transformants displayed similar
      biomass and fatty acid production comparing with the wild type strain. Our
      results demonstrated that exogenous genes could be expressed efficiently in
      transgenic Schizochytrium, suggesting that genetically engineered Schizochytrium 
      could be explored by this system.

AB  - Most boreal and temperate forest trees form a mutualistic symbiosis with soil
      borne fungi called ectomycorrhiza (ECM). In this association both partners
      benefit due to nutrient exchange at the symbiotic interface. Laccaria bicolor is 
      the first mycorrhizal fungus with its genome sequenced thus making possible for
      the first time to analyze genome scale gene expression profiles of a mutualistic 
      fungus. However, in order to be able to take full advantage of the genome
      sequence, reverse genetic tools are needed. Among them a high throughput
      transformation system is crucial. Herein we present a detailed protocol for
      genetic transformation of L. bicolor by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with
      emphasis on critical steps affecting the success and efficiency of the approach.

      regulators of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 3461-72
LID - 10.1128/JB.00317-11 [doi]
AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens encodes predicted iron-responsive
      regulators, Irr and RirA, that function in several other bacteria to control the 
      response to environmental iron levels. Deletion mutations of irr and rirA, alone 
      and in combination, were evaluated for their impact on cellular iron response.
      Growth was severely diminished in the Deltairr mutant under iron-limiting
      conditions, but reversed to wild-type levels in an Deltairr DeltarirA mutant. The
      level of uncomplexed iron in the Deltairr mutant was decreased, whereas the
      DeltarirA mutant exhibited elevated iron levels. Sensitivity of the Deltairr and 
      DeltarirA mutants to iron-activated antimicrobial compounds generally reflected
      their uncomplexed-iron levels. Expression of genes that encode iron uptake
      systems was decreased in the Deltairr mutant, whereas that of iron utilization
      genes was increased. Irr function required a trihistidine repeat likely to
      mediate interactions with heme. Iron uptake genes were derepressed in the
      DeltarirA mutant. In the Deltairr DeltarirA mutant, iron uptake and utilization
      genes were derepressed, roughly combining the phenotypes of the single mutants.
      Siderophore production was elevated in the rirA mutant, but most strongly
      regulated by an RirA-controlled sigma factor. Expression of rirA itself was
      regulated by Irr, RirA, and iron availability, in contrast to irr expression,
      which was relatively stable in the different mutants. These studies suggest that 
      in A. tumefaciens, the Irr protein is most active under low-iron conditions,
      inhibiting iron utilization and activating iron acquisition, while the RirA
      protein is active under high-iron conditions, repressing iron uptake.

AB  - With genome sequences of more and more fungi become available, high-throughput
      systematic -mutagenesis is desirable for functional genomics studies. While a
      number of random insertional mutagenesis and targeted gene disruption approaches 
      have been used in filamentous fungi, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      Transformation (ATMT) remains one of the most effective methods for identifying
      genes required for specific fungal developmental or infection processes. Because 
      of its simplicity, ATMT is suitable for large-scale insertion mutagenesis in
      fungi. Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus is a model for studying
      host-pathogen interactions. Here, we describe protocols for generating a M.
      oryzae mutant library consisting of over 70,000 ATMT transformants and for
      identifying genes -disrupted by T-DNA in the mutants by TAIL-PCR.

      conidiation-defective mutant].
PG  - 270-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Development of a method of transforming Aspergillus niger
      conidiospores with Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA system and using it as a tool 
      for genome annotation via construction a T-DNA insertion mutant library of A.
      niger. METHODS: A. tumefaciens EHA105 carrying the binary vector pCAMBIA1301 was 
      used to transform A. niger conidiospores under induction conditions. Hygromycin
      resistant transformants were screened on the selected medium. Sequence analysis
      was performed using inverse PCR method in stable mutants. RESULTS: In total, 193 
      hygromycin resistant stable transformants were obtained and the transformation
      rate was about 5.6 x 10(2) transformants /10(8) conidiospores. Obvious
      morphological changes were observed in some mutants and sequence analysis of
      T-DNA inserted site was performed in one conidiation-defective mutant. The result
      showed that the interrupted gene belonged to major facilitator superfamily (MFS).
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the transformation system of A. niger
      conidiospores set up in this study, combing with sequence analysis of T-DNA
      insertion site, might be an effective way for genome annotation in A. niger.

AB  - The availability of enzymes with a high promiscuity/specificity relationship
      permits the hydrolysis of several substrates with a view to obtaining a certain
      product or using one enzyme for several productive lines.
      N-Carbamoyl-beta-alanine amidohydrolase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      (Atbetacar) has shown high versatility to hydrolyze different N-carbamoyl-,
      N-acetyl- and N-formyl-amino acids to produce different alpha, beta, gamma and
      delta amino acids. We have calculated the promiscuity index for the enzyme,
      obtaining a value of 0.54, which indicates that it is a modestly promiscuous
      enzyme. Atbetacar presented the highest probability of hydrolysis for
      N-carbamoyl-amino acids, being the enzyme more efficient for the production of
      alpha-amino acids. We have also demonstrated by mutagenesis, modelling, kinetic
      and binding experiments that W218 and A359 indirectly influence the plasticity of
      the enzyme due to interaction with the environment of R291, the key residue for
      catalytic activity.

      Rosellinia necatrix.
PG  - 86-92
AB  - Rosellinia necatrix is a soil-borne root pathogen affecting a wide range of
      commercially important plant species. The mycelium of R. necatrix was transformed
      to hygromycin B resistance by an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation system using a binary plasmid vector containing the hygromycin B
      phosphotransferase (hph) gene controlled by the heterologous fungal Aspergillus
      nidulans P-gpd (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter and the trpC
      terminator. Co-cultivation of R. necatrix strain W1015 and A. tumefaciens strain 
      AGL-1 at 25 degrees C using the binary vector pAN26-CB1300, which contained the
      hygromycin B resistance cassette based on pAN26 and pCAMBIA1300, resulted in high
      frequencies of transformation. The presence of the hph gene in the transformants 
      was detected by PCR, and single-copy integration of the marker gene was
      demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. This report of an Agrobacterium-mediated 
      transformation method should allow the development of T-DNA tagging as a system f
      or insertional mutagenesis in R necatrix and provide a simple and reliable method
      for genetic manipulation.

TI  - ACC deaminase activity in avirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens D3.
PG  - 278-86
LID - 10.1139/w11-006 [doi]
AB  - Some plant-growth-promoting bacteria encode the enzyme
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, which breaks down ACC, the
      direct precursor of ethylene biosynthesis in all higher plants, into ammonia and 
      alpha-ketobutyrate and, as a result, reduces stress ethylene levels in plants
      caused by a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. It was previously shown
      that ACC deaminase can inhibit crown gall development induced by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens and can partially protect plants from this disease. Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens D3 has been previously reported to contain a putative ACC deaminase
      structural gene (acdS) and a regulatory gene (acdR = lrpL). In the present study,
      it was found that A. tumefaciens D3 is an avirulent strain. ACC deaminase
      activity and its regulation were also characterized. Under gnotobiotic
      conditions, wild-type A. tumefaciens D3 was shown to be able to promote plant
      root elongation, while the acdS and lrpL double mutant strain A. tumefaciens D3-1
      lost that ability. When co-inoculated with the virulent strain, A. tumefaciens
      C58, in wounded castor bean plants, both the wild-type A. tumefaciens D3 and the 
      mutant A. tumefaciens D3-1 were found to be able to significantly inhibit crown
      gall development induced by A. tumefaciens C58.

      active against Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 300-14
LID - 10.1007/s12010-011-9252-9 [doi]
AB  - This study reports on the identification, characterization and purification of a 
      new bacteriocin, named Bacthuricin F103, from a Bacillus thuringiensis strain
      BUPM103. Bacthuricin F103 production began in the early exponential phase and
      reached a maximum in the middle of the same phase. Two chromatographic methods
      based on high performance liquid chromatography and fast protein liquid
      chromatography systems were used to purify Bacthuricin F103. Sodium dodecyl
      sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that this bacteriocin had a 
      molecular weight of approximately 11 kDa. It also showed a wide range of
      thermostability of up to 80 degrees C for 60 min and a broad spectrum of
      antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 3.0-10.0. This bacteriocin was noted,
      and for the first time, to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity against
      Agrobacterium subsp. strains, the major causal agents of crown gall disease in
      tomato and vineyard crops, and against several challenging organisms in food,
      such as Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. Complete killing with
      immediate impact on cells was observed within a short period of time. The
      sequence obtained for Bacthuricin F103 by direct N-terminal sequencing shared
      considerable homology with hemolysin. Bacthuricin F103 was noted to act through
      the depletion of intracellular ions, which suggest that the cell membrane was a
      possible target to Bacthuricin F103.

TI  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens transcription factor BlcR is regulated via
      oligomerization.
PG  - 20431-40
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.196154 [doi]
AB  - The Agrobacterium tumefaciens BlcR is a member of the emerging isocitrate lyase
      transcription regulators that negatively regulates metabolism of
      gamma-butyrolactone, and its repressing function is relieved by succinate
      semialdehyde (SSA). Our crystal structure showed that BlcR folded into the DNA-
      and SSA-binding domains and dimerized via the DNA-binding domains. Mutational
      analysis identified residues, including Phe(147), that are important for SSA
      association; BlcR(F147A) existed as tetramer. Two BlcR dimers bound to target DNA
      and in a cooperative manner, and the distance between the two BlcR-binding
      sequences in DNA was critical for BlcR-DNA association. Tetrameric BlcR(F147A)
      retained DNA binding activity, and importantly, this activity was not affected by
      the distance separating the BlcR-binding sequences in DNA. SSA did not dissociate
      tetrameric BlcR(F147A) or BlcR(F147A)-DNA. As well as in the SSA-binding site,
      Phe(147) is located in a structurally flexible loop that may be involved in BlcR 
      oligomerization. We propose that SSA regulates BlcR DNA-binding function via
      oligomerization.

TI  - [Transformation system of Aspergillus japonicus mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens].
PG  - 115-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In to order to select Aspergillus japonicus mutant strains that
      express high-yield of glycerol oxidase, we constructed a mutant library of
      Aspergillus japonicus that mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. METHODS:
      Tri-relative hybridization experiments were performed to transfer binary vector
      pB I -hph II into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 that was used as the infective
      strain and Aspergillus japonicus was used as the host strain. We established the 
      transformation system of Aspergillus japonicus mediated by Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens and constructed a mutant library. At the same time, we analyzed the
      factors affecting the transformation efficiency such as the concentration of
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens, adding and not adding Acetosyringone, co-culture time,
      and co-culture temperature. RESULTS: PCR detection and Southern blot analysis
      showed that the T-DNA was integrated into genme of the Aspergillus japonicus. All
      9 randomly selected transformants were stable after 10 rounds of successive
      cultures. CONCLUSION: The transformation system is a good basis for selection of 
      Aspergillus japonicus mutant strains that express high-yield of glycerol oxidase.

PG  - 129-36

AB  - Transgenic plants of an Indian isolate of Lemna minor have been developed for the
      first time using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and hard nodular cell masses 'nodular 
      calli' developed on the BAP - pretreated daughter frond explants in B5 medium
      containing sucrose (1.0 %) with 2,4-D (5.0 muM) and 2-iP (50.0 muM) or 2,4-D
      (50.0 muM) and TDZ (5.0 muM) under light conditions. These calli were co-cultured
      with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring a binary vector that contained genes 
      for beta-glucuronidase with intron and neomycin phosphortransferase. Transformed 
      cells selected on kanamycin selection medium were regenerated into fronds whose
      transgenic nature was confirmed by histochemical assay for GUS activity, PCR
      analysis and Southern hybridization. The frequency of transformation obtained was
      3.8 % and a period of 11-13 weeks was required from initiation of cultures from
      explants to fully grown transgenic fronds. The pretreatment of daughter fronds
      with BAP, use of non-ionic surfactant, presence of acetosyringone in
      co-cultivation medium, co-culture duration of 3 d and 16 h photoperiod during
      culture were found crucial for callus induction, frond regeneration and
      transformation of L. minor. This transformation system can be used for the
      production of pharmaceutically important protein and in bioremediation.

TI  - Identification of pathogenicity-related genes in the vascular wilt fungus
      Verticillium dahliae by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated T-DNA insertional
      mutagenesis.
PG  - 209-21
LID - 10.1007/s12033-011-9392-8 [doi]
AB  - Verticillium dahliae is the causal agent of vascular wilt in many economically
      important crops worldwide. Identification of genes that control pathogenicity or 
      virulence may suggest targets for alternative control methods for this fungus. In
      this study, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) was applied 
      for insertional mutagenesis of V. dahliae conidia. Southern blot analysis
      indicated that T-DNAs were inserted randomly into the V. dahliae genome and that 
      69% of the transformants were the result of single copy T-DNA insertion. DNA
      sequences flanking T-DNA insertion were isolated through inverse PCR (iPCR), and 
      these sequences were aligned to the genome sequence to identify the genomic
      position of insertion. V. dahliae mutants of particular interest selected based
      on culture phenotypes included those that had lost the ability to form
      microsclerotia and subsequently used for virulence assay. Based on the virulence 
      assay of 181 transformants, we identified several mutant strains of V. dahliae
      that did not cause symptoms on lettuce plants. Among these mutants, T-DNA was
      inserted in genes encoding an endoglucanase 1 (VdEg-1), a hydroxyl-methyl
      glutaryl-CoA synthase (VdHMGS), a major facilitator superfamily 1 (VdMFS1), and a
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) mannosyltransferase 3 (VdGPIM3). These results
      suggest that ATMT can effectively be used to identify genes associated with
      pathogenicity and other functions in V. dahliae.

      VirB11) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, underlining its importance for complex
      stability. To assess the importance of dimerization, we changed residues at the
      predicted dimer interface (V97, A100, Q93, and E94) in order to strengthen or to 
      abolish dimerization. We verified the impact of the changes on dimerization in
      vitro with purified V97 variants, followed by analysis of the in vivo
      consequences in a complemented virB8 deletion strain. Dimer formation was
      observed in vivo after the introduction of a cysteine residue at the predicted
      interface (V97C), and this variant supported DNA transfer, but the formation of
      elongated T pili was not detected by the standard pilus isolation technique.
      Variants with changes at V97 and A100 that weaken dimerization did not support
      type IV secretion system functions. The T-pilus component VirB2 cofractionated
      with high-molecular-mass core protein complexes extracted from the membranes, and
      the presence of VirB8 as well as its dimer interface were important for this
      association. We conclude that the VirB8 dimer interface is required for T4SS
      function, for the stabilization of many VirB proteins, and for targeting of VirB2
      to the T-pilus assembly site.

AB  - The genus Agrobacterium includes plant-associated bacteria and opportunistic
      human pathogens. Taxonomy and nomenclature within the genus remain controversial.
      In particular, isolates of human origin were all affiliated with the species
      Agrobacterium (Rhizobium) radiobacter, while phytopathogenic strains were
      designated under the synonym denomination Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In order to 
      study the relative distribution of Agrobacterium strains according to their
      origins, we performed a multilocus sequence-based analysis (MLSA) on a large
      collection of 89 clinical and environmental strains from various origins. We
      proposed an MLSA scheme based on the partial sequence of 7 housekeeping genes
      (atpD, zwf, trpE, groEL, dnaK, glnA, and rpoB) present on the circular chromosome
      of A. tumefaciens C58. Multilocus phylogeny revealed that 88% of the clinical
      strains belong to genovar A7, which formed a homogeneous population with linkage 
      disequilibrium, suggesting a low rate of recombination. Comparison of genomic
      fingerprints obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that the 
      strains of genovar A7 were epidemiologically unrelated. We present genetic
      evidence that genovar A7 may constitute a human-associated population distinct
      from the environmental population. Also, phenotypic characteristics, such as
      culture at 42 degrees C, agree with this statement. This human-associated
      population might represent a potential novel species in the genus Agrobacterium.

AB  - Cordyceps militaris is an insect-born fungus with various biological and
      pharmacological activities. The mutant library of C. militaris was constructed by
      improved Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT), for the
      ultimate identification of genes involved in isolate degeneration during fruiting
      body production. Successful transformation of C. militaris JM4 by A. tumefaciens 
      AGL-1 carrying vector pATMT1 was performed, with efficiency in the range of
      30-600 transformants per 1x10(5) conidia. Acetosyringone (AS) supplement in C.
      militaris ATMT was not necessary during either precultivation or cocultivation.
      The transformation procedure was optimised based on the ratios between donor A.
      tumefaciens and recipient conidia, and pH value of cocultivation media. The
      integration of the hyg gene into C. militaris genome was determined by PCR and
      Southern blot analysis, suggesting that 67-88% resulting transformants in
      cultivation conditions with or without AS were inserted by T-DNA and 55-80% were 
      single-copy. Special mutants with altered phenotypes and growth potentials were
      characterised. The efficient TAIL-PCR approach was established for identifying
      T-DNA flanking sequences from C. militaris mutants. The successful construction
      of the mutant library indicated the usefulness of this approach for functional
      genetic analysis in this important fungus.

      Agrobacterium tumefaciens fermentation.

AB  - The yield of CoQ(1)(0), an intracellular product extracted from Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens cells is dependent on the effectiveness of cell lysis post
      fermentation. Various cell lysis approaches are investigated, including
      ultrasound, repetitive freezing/thawing, grinding and acid-heat treatment. The
      acid-heat combination using hydrochloric acid is found the most effective in
      releasing CoQ(1)(0), followed by lactic, sulfuric, phosphoric and oxalic acids.
      The most significant processing parameters, namely the ratio of acid solution
      volume and bacteria weight (A/B ratio), incubation temperature and reaction time,
      are optimized by using the central composite design with a quadratic regression
      model built by response surface methodology. The highest CoQ(1)(0) yield at 1.518
      mg/g dry cell is attained using hydrochloric acid (3 mol/L) under optimal A/B
      ratio, temperature and time at 10.8 mL/g, 84.2 degrees C and 35.3 min,
      respectively.

TI  - Small RNA-mediated control of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens GABA binding protein.
PG  - 492-506
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07589.x [doi]
AB  - Wounded plants activate a complex defence programme in response to Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens. They synthesize the non-proteinogenic amino acid gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA), which stimulates degradation of the quorum sensing signal
      N-(3-oxo-octanoyl) homoserine lactone. GABA is transported into A. tumefaciens
      via an ABC transporter dependent on the periplasmic binding protein Atu2422. We
      demonstrate that expression of atu2422 and two other ABC transporter genes is
      downregulated by the conserved small RNA (sRNA) AbcR1 (for ABC regulator). AbcR1 
      is encoded in tandem with another sRNA, which is similar in sequence and
      structure. Both sRNAs accumulate during stationary phase but only the absence of 
      AbcR1 resulted in significant accumulation of Atu2422 and increased GABA import. 
      AbcR1 inhibits initiation of atu2422 translation by masking its Shine-Dalgarno
      sequence and thereby reduces stability of the atu2422 transcript. It is the first
      described bacterial sRNA that controls uptake of a plant-generated signalling
      molecule. Given that similar sRNAs and ABC transporter genes are present in
      various Rhizobiaceae and in Brucella, it is likely that such sRNA-mediated
      control impacts a number of host-microbe interactions.

      selection for antibiotic resistance and visual selection of green fluorescent
      protein (GFP)-fusion reporter targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
      Transformation with A. rhizogenes was stable for over 2 years, whereas
      transformation by A. tumefaciens resulted in non-regenerable stable
      transformation which was restricted solely to transgenic callus and lasted only
      6-8 weeks. However, shoots regenerated from this callus appeared to be
      non-transgenic. Importantly, callus and root cells stably transformed with A.
      rhizogenes showed typical regular organization and dynamics of ER as visualized
      by GFP-ER marker. On the other hand, callus cells transformed with A. tumefaciens
      showed disintegrated ER structure and impaired dynamics which was accompanied
      with developmental degradation of GFP. Consequently, shoots which regenerated
      from such callus were all non-transgenic. Possible reasons for this
      non-regenerable flax transformation by A. tumefaciens are discussed.

PG  - 1458-66
AB  - The cointegration rate into the aspen and birch genomes of foreign genes from a
      binary vector and a disarmed Ti plasmid pCBE21 carried by the same Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens strain was studied. The cotransformation rate for the genes within
      the Ti plasmid varied from 30 to 100%; while the transformation rate for the gene
      from T(L) region was twofold higher as compared with the T(R) region. On the
      average, the gene transfer from all three T-DNAs was recorded in 10.9% of the
      transgenic lines. For the vector pBI121, the cotransformation rates for the genes
      from both regions of pCBE21 T-DNA were higher as compared with the vector pGS. In
      addition, a concurrent transfer of the genes from the Ti plasmid T(L) and T(R)
      regions was recorded only after the transformation with the vector pBI121. These 
      results can be used for constructing woody plants containing several genes.

      Sporothrix schenckii using Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 418-22

AB  - Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes human and
      animal sporotrichosis globally. Here we developed and optimized an Agrobacterium 
      tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system of S. schenckii for insertional
      mutagenesis. The transformation efficiency reached more than 600 transformants
      per 10(6) conidia. Using this protocol enabled us to obtain a large number of
      T-DNA insertional mutants within a short experimental period. Several mutants
      with altered phenotypes were obtained during the transformation experiments. The 
      mutants displayed mitotic stability. Transferred DNA (T-DNA) flanking sequences
      were cloned by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR). Our results
      demonstrated that the ATMT system can be an effective tool for insertional
      mutagenesis in S. schenckii. This is the first report of a suitable mutagenesis
      system which may provide valuable mutants and information for both forward and
      reverse genetics research in the future for this medically important fungus.

AB  - In this study, an Agrobacteriurn tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT)
      protocol was successfully developed for the genetic transformation of a
      taxol-producing fungus, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, and the co-cultivation 
      conditions affecting the transformation efficiency were optimized. The optimal
      transformation conditions were that 1 ml of C. cladosporioides MD2 spore
      suspension (10(8) spores/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of A. tumefaciens
      cultures, which contained 400 mul of A. tumefaciens LBA4404 (OD(660)
      approximately 0.6) and 600 mul LB medium that were used to make up difference in 
      volume, and the mix cultures were supplemented with 300 muM acetosyringone (AS)
      and co-cultivated at 26 degrees C and 50 rpm for 48 h. Stable transformants were 
      obtained through analysis of the mitotic stability of inserted T-DNA and the
      presence of hygromycin resistance gene (hpt II). This study laid a fine
      groundwork for development of transgenic C. cladosporioides MD2 strains.

TI  - The integrity of the periplasmic domain of the VirA sensor kinase is critical for
      optimal coordination of the virulence signal response in Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens.
PG  - 1436-48
LID - 10.1128/JB.01227-10 [doi]
AB  - The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens responds to three main signals at
      the plant-bacterium interface: phenolics, such as acetosyringone (AS),
      monosaccharides, and acidic pH ( approximately 5.5). These signals are transduced
      via the chromosomally encoded sugar binding protein ChvE and the Ti
      plasmid-encoded VirA/VirG two-component regulatory system, resulting in the
      transcriptional activation of the Ti plasmid virulence genes. Here, we present
      genetic and physical evidence that the periplasmic domain of VirA dimerizes
      independently of other parts of the protein, and we examine the effects of
      several engineered mutations in the periplasmic and transmembrane regions of VirA
      on vir-inducing capacity as indicated by AS sensitivity and maximal level of
      vir-inducing activity at saturating AS levels. The data indicate that
      helix-breaking mutations throughout the periplasmic domain of VirA or mutations
      that reposition the second transmembrane domain (TM2) of VirA relieve the
      periplasmic domain's repressive effects on the maximal activity of this kinase in
      response to phenolics, effects normally relieved only when ChvE, sugars, and low 
      pH are also present. Such relief, however, does not sensitize VirA to low
      concentrations of phenolics, the other major effect of the ChvE-sugar and low pH 
      signals. We further demonstrate that amino acid residues in a small Trg-like
      motif in the periplasmic domain of VirA are crucial for transmission of the
      ChvE-sugar signal to the cytoplasmic domain. These experiments provide evidence
      that small perturbations in the periplasmic domain of VirA can uncouple
      sugar-mediated changes in AS sensitivity from the sugar-mediated effects on
      maximal activity.

      immature embryos.
PG  - 355-72
LID - 10.1007/978-1-61737-988-8_24 [doi]
AB  - A critical step in the development of a robust Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
      transformation -system for cereal crop plants is the establishment of optimal
      conditions for efficient T-DNA delivery into target tissue, from which plants can
      be regenerated. Although, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cereals is an 
      important method that has been widely used by many laboratories around the world,
      routine protocols have been established only in specific cultivars within a
      species and with specific tissues of high regeneration potential. Cocultivation
      of highly embryogenic callus tissue or healthy immature embryos with A.
      tumefaciens is considered one of the critical factors in successful genetic
      transformation of crop plants. Immature embryos collected only from vigorously
      growing healthy and green plants grown in the field or in the well-conditioned
      greenhouse are the ideal target for genetic transformation of recalcitrant crop
      species. Here, we describe an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method that
      uses immature embryos as the starting material for inoculation with
      Agrobacterium. The aim of this chapter is to provide the key steps/components
      involved in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cereal crops. However, these
      steps or components often vary between protocols and from laboratory to
      laboratory, and can be optimized or modified based on the requirement of a
      specific cultivar or species.

      tumefaciens harbouring the plasmid pBI121 with GUS gene uidA and kanamycin
      resistance gene nptII was used. Highest transformation efficiency of 1.4
      transgenic shoots/responded explant was obtained when pre-plasmolysed leaves,
      pre-incubated on shoot bud induction medium for 10 days, were subjected to
      sonication for 30 s prior to transformation. Using a selection medium containing 
      50 mg kanamycin l(-1), transformants grew into micro-shoots and formed roots on a
      hormone-free half strength MS medium. The transgenic nature of the regenerated
      plants was confirmed by PCR amplification of uidA gene and GUS histochemical
      assay.

AB  - We report the biochemical characterization of a novel haloalkane dehalogenase,
      DatA, isolated from the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58. DatA
      possesses a peculiar pair of halide-stabilizing residues, Asn-Tyr, which have not
      been reported to play this role in other known haloalkane dehalogenases. DatA has
      a number of other unique characteristics, including substrate-dependent and
      cooperative kinetics, a dimeric structure, and excellent enantioselectivity
      toward racemic mixtures of chiral brominated alkanes and esters.

AB  - Plant transformation efficiency depends on the ability of the transgene to
      successfully interact with plant host factors. Our previous work and the work of 
      others showed that manipulation of the activity of host factors allows for
      increased frequency of transformation. Recently we reported that exposure of
      tobacco plants to increased concentrations of ammonium nitrate increases the
      frequency of both homologous recombination and plant transgenesis. Here we tested
      the influence of KCl and salts of rare earth elements, Ce and La on the
      efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. We found that exposure
      to KCl, CeCl(3) and LaCl(3) leads to an increase in recombination frequency in
      Arabidopsis and tobacco. Plants grown in the presence of CeCl(3) and LaCl(3) had 
      higher biomass, longer roots and greater root number. Analysis of transformation 
      efficiency showed that exposure of tobacco plants to 50 mM KCl resulted in
      ~6.0-fold increase in the number of regenerated calli and transgenic plants as
      compared to control plants. Exposure to various concentrations of CeCl(3) showed 
      a maximum increase of ~3.0-fold in both the number of calli and transgenic
      plants. Segregation analysis showed that exposure to KCl and cerium (III)
      chloride leads to more frequent integrations of the transgene at a single locus. 
      Analysis of transgene intactness showed better preservation of right T-DNA border
      during transgene integration. Our data suggest that KCl and CeCl(3) can be
      effectively used to improve quantity and quality of transgene integrations.

TI  - Identification of virulence genes in the corn pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola
      by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
PG  - 43-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00651.x [doi]
AB  - A previously developed Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT)
      protocol for the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum graminicola led to high
      rates of tandem integration of the whole Ti-plasmid, and was therefore considered
      to be unsuitable for the identification of pathogenicity and virulence genes by
      insertional mutagenesis in this pathogen. We used a modified ATMT protocol with
      acetosyringone present only during the co-cultivation of C. graminicola and A.
      tumefaciens. Analysis of 105 single-spore isolates randomly chosen from a
      collection of approximately 2000 transformants, indicated that almost 70% of the 
      transformants had single T-DNA integrations. Of 500 independent transformants
      tested, 10 exhibited attenuated virulence in infection assays on whole plants.
      Microscopic analyses primarily revealed defects at different pre-penetration
      stages of infection-related morphogenesis. Three transformants were characterized
      in detail. The identification of the T-DNA integration sites was performed by
      amplification of genomic DNA ends after endonuclease digestion and polynucleotide
      tailing. In one transformant, the T-DNA had integrated into the 5'-flank of a
      gene with similarity to allantoicase genes of other Ascomycota. In the second and
      third transformants, the T-DNA had integrated into an open reading frame (ORF)
      and into the 5'-flank of an ORF. In both cases, the ORFs have unknown function.

AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform the vegetative dikaryotic
      mycelium of Flammulina velutipes using a hygromycin B resistance gene as
      selectable marker. The gene coding for urogen III methyltransferase (cob) was
      introduced into F. velutipes dikaryotic cells. The resulting transformant cells
      generated a bright red fluorescence, indicating that cob is promising as a
      reporter gene in F. velutipes.

TI  - Structural characterization of a group II 2/2 hemoglobin from the plant pathogen 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
PG  - 810-6

AB  - Within the 2/2 hemoglobin sub-family, no group II 2/2Hbs from proteobacteria have
      been so far studied. Here we present the first structural characterization of a
      group II 2/2Hb from the soil and phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens (At-2/2HbO). The crystal structure of ferric At-2/2HbO (reported at
      2.1A resolution) shows the location of specific/unique heme distal site residues 
      (e.g., His(42)CD1, a residue distinctive of proteobacteria group II 2/2Hbs) that 
      surround a heme-liganded water molecule. A highly intertwined hydrogen-bonded
      network, involving residues Tyr(26)B10, His(42)CD1, Ser(49)E7, Trp(93)G8, and
      three distal site water molecules, stabilizes the heme-bound ligand. Such a
      structural organization suggests a path for diatomic ligand diffusion to/from the
      heme. Neither a similar distal site structuring effect nor the presence of distal
      site water molecules has been so far observed in group I and group III 2/2Hbs,
      thus adding new distinctive information to the complex picture of currently
      available 2/2Hb structural and functional data. This article is part of a Special
      Issue entitled: Protein Structure and Function in the Crystalline State.

AB  - Single transgene copy, vector backbone-free transgenic crop plants are highly
      desired for functional genomics and many biotechnological applications. We
      demonstrate that binary vectors that use a replication origin derived from the Ri
      plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (oriRi) increase the frequency of single
      copy, backbone-free transgenic plants in Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated
      transformation of soybean, canola, and corn, compared to RK2-derived binary
      vectors (RK2 oriV). In large scale soybean transformation experiments, the
      frequency of single copy, backbone-free transgenic plants was nearly doubled in
      two versions of the oriRi vectors compared to the RK2 oriV control vector. In
      canola transformation experiments, the oriRi vector produced more single copy,
      backbone-free transgenic plants than did the RK2 oriV vector. In corn
      transformation experiments, the frequency of single copy backbone-free transgenic
      plants was also significantly increased when using the oriRi vector, although the
      transformation frequency dropped. These results, derived from transformation
      experiments using three crops, indicate the advantage of oriRi vectors over RK2
      oriV binary vectors for the production of single copy, backbone-free transgenic
      plants using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

AB  - In most bacteria, a global level of regulation exists involving intercellular
      communication via the production and response to cell density-dependent signal
      molecules. This cell density-dependent regulation has been termed quorum sensing 
      (QS). QS is a global regulator, which has been associated with a number of
      important features in bacteria including virulence regulation and biofilm
      formation. Consequently, there is considerable interest in understanding,
      detecting, and inhibiting QS. Acyl homoserine lactones (acyl HSLs) are used as
      extracellular QS signals by a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Chromobacterium 
      violaceum, a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in soil and water, produces
      the characteristic purple pigment violacein, the production of which is regulated
      by acyl HSL-mediated QS. Based on this readily observed pigmentation phenotype,
      C. violaceum strains can be used to detect various aspects of acyl HSL-mediated
      QS activity. In another commonly used bioassay organism, Agrobacterium
      tumefaciens, QS can be detected by the use of a reporter gene such as lacZ. Here,
      we describe several commonly used approaches incorporating C. violaceum and A.
      tumefaciens that can be used to detect acyl HSLs and QS inhibition.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation for investigation of somatic
      recombination in the fungal pathogen Armillaria mellea.
PG  - 7990-6
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01049-10 [doi]
AB  - Armillaria root disease is one of the most damaging timber and fruit tree
      diseases in the world. Despite its economic importance, many basic questions
      about the biology of the causal fungi, Armillaria spp., are unanswered. For
      example, Armillaria undergoes matings between diploid and haploid mycelia, which 
      can result in a recombinant diploid without meiosis. Evidence of such somatic
      recombination in natural populations suggests that this reproductive mode may
      affect the pathogen's ecology. Investigations of the mechanisms and adaptive
      consequences of somatic recombination are, however, hampered by the lack of a
      method to reliably synthesize somatic recombinants. Here we report the first
      genetic transformation system for the genus Armillaria. We transformed A. mellea 
      with selective markers for use in diploid-haploid matings to reliably synthesize 
      somatic recombinants. This was accomplished with Agrobacterium tumefaciens
      carrying pBGgHg, which carries the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph). hph 
      was integrated into transformants, as evidenced by serial transfer to selective
      media, PCR, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Southern hybridization.
      Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were developed to genotype synthesized mycelia.
      In matings between a wild-type diploid and hygromycin-resistant haploids
      (transgenic), we identified recombinant, hygromycin-resistant diploids and,
      additionally, hygromycin-resistant triploids, all with the mitochondrial
      haplotype of the haploid partner. Our approach created no mycelium in which the
      haploid nucleus was replaced by the diploid nucleus, the typical outcome of
      diploid-haploid matings in Armillaria. This genetic transformation system, in
      combination with new markers to track chromosomal and cytoplasmic inheritance in 
      A. mellea, will advance research aimed at characterizing the significance of
      somatic recombination in the ecology of this important fungus.
